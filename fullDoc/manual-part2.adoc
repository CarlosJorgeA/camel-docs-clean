= Camel Catalog

Each release includes a catalog with all sorts of information about what’s included in the release.

== About Camel Catalog

The catalog is shipped in an independent standalone `camel-catalog` JAR containing the following information:

- List of all components, data formats, languages, EIPs, and everything else in the release
- Curated lists for Camel Quarkus, Camel Spring Boot, and Camel Main runtimes
- JSON schema with extensive details for every option
- Human-readable documentation for every option
- Categorization of options (for example, find all database components)
- XML schema for the XML DSLs

There is also a Java API for tooling:

- validating Camel endpoints and the Simple language
- creating Camel endpoint URLs

The catalog provides a wealth of information that tooling can tap into and use.

=== Tooling using Camel Catalog

The following tools uses the catalog in their editor:

- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9371-apache-camel-idea-plugin[Camel tooling for IDEA]
- https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/language-support-apache-camel[Camel tooling for Eclipse]
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-apache-camel[Camel tooling for VS Code]
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=camel-karavan.karavan[Camel Karavan for VS Code]
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-kaoto[Kaoto for VS Code]
- https://hawt.io/[Hawtio]

The xref:camel-report-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Maven validation] plugin uses the catalog during validation of all the
Camel endpoints found while scanning the source code.

=== Layout of camel-catalog

JAR includes the information using the following directory layout:

[source,text]
----
org
└── apache
  └── camel
    └── catalog
      ├── beans (JSON schema)
      ├── components (JSON schema)
      ├── dataformats (JSON schema)
      ├── dev-consoles (JSON schema)
      ├── languages (JSON schema)
      ├── main (JSON schema)
      ├── models (JSON schema)
      ├── others (JSON schema)
      ├── releases (JSON schema)
      ├── schemas (XML schema)
      └── transformers (JSON schema)
----

Each directory contains files with the information. Every Camel component is included
as JSON schema files in the components directory. For example, the Timer component
is included in the file timer.json.
= Camel Component Maven Plugin

The
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/main/tooling/maven/camel-component-maven-plugin[Camel Component
Maven Plugin] allows third party component developers to generate all the necessary metadata and Java classes for configurations to be used since Camel 3.x. These metadata files and Java files allows for more efficiency and faster runs for your component.

== Goals Supported

The following goal is supported:

=== generate

This goal will generate the following metadata files and Java files:

* Jandex index: it will generate a Jandex index for used Java annotations within the project which allows to more efficiency to search and load the annotations to generate other metadata as mentioned below.
* Type Converter Loader: it will generate a loader for xref:type-converter.adoc[type converter] annotated with `@Converter(loader = true)` to allow faster way for Camel to load these converters.
* SPIs: it will generate all Service Provider Interfaces (SPI) for the component. This allows Camel to auto-discover your component without adding it manually to the Camel context.
* Configurers: it will generate all configurer Java classes from `@Configurer` annotated classes.
* Endpoint Schema: it will generate the property configurers as well as schema JSONs extracted from the component's Endpoint and Component classes. This allows Camel to avoid reflections while configuring the properties, thus allows for better efficiency.
* Endpoint URI Factory: it will generate endpoint factory to build URIs from a map of properties.
* Invoke on Header: it will generate source code for components using `@InvokeOnHeader`
* Prepare Component: it analyzes if the maven module contains Camel modules such as `components`, `dataformats`, `languages` and others. And for each of those generates extra descriptors and schema files for easier auto-discovery in Camel and tooling. 
* Validate Component: it validates the Camel component if the meta-files for `components`, `dataformats`, `languages` and others, all contains the needed meta-data such as assigned labels, documentation for each option.

[NOTE]
====
In order for the plugin to work probably, you will need to have the proper Camel annotations in your component. Example, `@Component` for component class, `@UriEndpoint` for endpoint class, `@UriParams` ..etc. You can take a look at these annotation how being used in any of the existing Camel components in github. Or even better, you can use xref:camel-maven-archetypes.adoc[Camel Maven Archetypes] to bootstrap the initial component, this already include all the necessary batteries for your component such as necessary initial Java classes, annotation and maven `pom.xml`.
====

== Adding the plugin to your pom.xml

In case you *did not* use the Camel Maven Archetypes to bootstrap the initial component project, you will need to add the following to your `pom.xml` build section:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-component-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${camel-version}</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generate</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>generate</goal>
      </goals>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
    </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
----

This will attach the plugin `generate` goal to Maven's `process-classes`,
in order to generate all the necessary files being described above upon compilation.

Thus, `mvn test`, `mvn package`, `mvn verify` and `mvn install` phases should run this plugin.

=== Re-compile to include latest generated code

The `camel-component-maven-plugin` is executed after the compiler, and because it outputs java source
code, then the compiler must execute again (will only compile if source code has actually changed).

To ensure this the following should be added to the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>recompile</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
            <phase>process-classes</phase>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

=== Configuring output directory

The plugin will by default generate outputs to

- `src/generated/java` - for generated java source code
- `src/generated/resources` - for generated resource files

To include these folders with the Java compiler, then you can configure Maven to include those directories:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>add-source</goal>
                <goal>add-resource</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <sources>
                    <source>src/generated/java</source>
                </sources>
                <resources>
                    <resource>
                        <directory>src/generated/resources</directory>
                    </resource>
                </resources>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

However, if you want, you can also configure the `camel-component-maven-plugin` to output directly
to `src/main` as shown (then you do not need to use the `build-helper-maven-plugin` as we do above):

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-component-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${camel-version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <sourcesOutputDir>src/main/java</sourcesOutputDir>
    <resourcesOutputDir>src/main/resources</resourcesOutputDir>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generate</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>generate</goal>
      </goals>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
    </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
----
= JSSE Utility

The JSSE Utility allows you to easily configure aspects of the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html[Java
Secure Socket Extension] (JSSE) API in order to greatly simplify the use
of custom transport layer security (TLS) settings on Camel components.

== Supported JSSE Components

A number of Camel components support this (such as but not limited to):

* xref:components::cometd-component.adoc[Cometd]
* xref:components::http-component.adoc[HTTP]
* xref:components::irc-component.adoc[IRC]
* xref:components::jetty-component.adoc[Jetty]
* xref:components::netty-component.adoc[Netty]
* xref:components::mail-component.adoc[Mail]

== Configuring JSSE with Camel

The key component in configuring TLS through the JSSE API is the `SSLContext`.

The `SSLContext` provides socket factories for both client side and server side sockets
as well as another component called an `SSLEngine` that is used by non-blocking IO to support TLS.

The JSSE configuration utility provides an easy-to-use builder for configuring
these JSSE components, among others, in a manner that allows you to provide all
configuration options up front during the initialization of your
application such that you don't have to customize library code or dig
though the inner workings of a third-party library in order to inject
hooks for the configuration of each component in the JSSE API.  The
central builder in the JSSE configuration utility is the
SSLContextParameters. This class serves as the entry point for most
configuration in the JSSE utility.

=== SSLContextParameters

`SSLContextParameters` (`<sslContextParameters>` XML tag)
contain the following elements:

* provider (attribute)
* secureSocketProtocol (attribute)
* certAlias (attribute)
* sessionTimeout (attribute)
* cipherSuites (element)
* cipherSuitesFilter (element)
* secureSocketProtocols (element)
* secureSocketProtocolsFilter (element)
* keyManagers (element)
* trustManagers (element)
* secureRandom (element)
* clientParameters (element)
* serverParameters (element)

provider::
The optional provider identifier for the JSSE implementation to use when
constructing the SSLContext. If omitted, the standard provider look-up
mechanism is used to resolve the provider.
secureSocketProtocol::
The optional secure socket protocol. See https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html[Java Security Standard Algorithm Names]
for information about standard protocol names. If omitted, TLS is used by default.
Note that this property is related to but distinctly different from the
secureSocketProtocols and secureSocketProtocolsFilter properties.
certAlias::
An optional certificate alias to use. This is useful when
the keystore has multiple certificates.
sessionTimeout::
This optional property defines the timeout period, in seconds, for
sessions on both the client and server side as well as in the SSLEngine.
cipherSuites::
This optional property represents a collection of explicitly named
cipher suites to enable on both the client and server side as well as in
the SSLEngine. These values take precedence over filters supplied in
cipherSuitesFilter. The utility attempts to enable the listed cipher
suites regardless of whether the JSSE provider actually supports
them or not. This behavior guarantees that listed cipher suites are
always enabled when listed. For a more lenient option, use
cipherSuitesFilter.
cipherSuitesFilter::
This optional property represents a collection of include and exclude
patterns for cipher suites to enable on both the client and server side
as well as in the SSLEngine. The patterns are applied over only the
available cipher suites. The excludes patterns have precedence over the
includes patterns. If no cipherSuites and no cipherSuitesFilter are
present, the default patterns applied are:

[source,text]
----
Includes .\*;
Excludes .*_NULL_.*, .\*_anon_.*, .\*DES.*, .\*EXPORT.*, .\*MD5, .*RC4.*
----

secureSocketProtocols::
This optional property represents a collection of explicitly named
secure socket protocols, such as SSLv3/TLS/etc., to enable on both the
client and server side as well as in the SSLEngine. These values take
precedence over filters supplied in secureSocketProtocolsFilter.  The
utility attempts to enable the listed protocols regardless of whether
the JSSE provider actually supports them or not. This behavior
guarantees that listed protocols are always enabled when listed. For a
more lenient option, use secureSocketProtocolsFilter.
secureSocketProtocolsFilter::
This optional property represents a collection of include and exclude
patterns for secure socket protocols to enable on both the client and
server side as well as in the SSLEngine. The patterns are applied over
only the available protocols. The excludes patterns have precedence over
the includes patterns. If no secureSocketProtocols and no
secureSocketProtocolsFilter are present, the default patterns applied
are:

[source,text]
----
Includes .*
----

keyManagers::
This optional property configures the source of key material for
providing identity of client and server side connections as well as in
the SSLEngine. If omitted, no source of key material is provided and
the SSLContext is suitable only for client-side usage when mutual
authentication is not in use. You typically configure this property
with a key store containing a client or server private key.
trustManagers::
This optional property configures the source of material for verifying
trust of key material used in the handshake process. If omitted, the
default trust manager is automatically used. See the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-7D9F43B8-AABF-4C5B-93E6-3AFB18B66150[JSSE
documentation] for more information on how the default trust manager is
configured. You typically configure this property with a key store
containing trusted CA certificates.
secureRandom::
This optional property configures the secure random number generator
used by the client and server side as well as in the SSLEngine. If
omitted, the default secure random number generator is used.
clientParameters::
This optional property configures additional settings that apply only to
the client side aspects of the SSLContext. If present, these settings
override the settings specified at the SSLContextParameters level.
serverParameters::
This optional property configures additional settings that apply only to
the server side aspects of the SSLContext. If present, these settings
override the settings specified at the SSLContextParameters level.


=== KeyManagersParameters

KeyManagersParameters contain the following elements:

* keyPassword (attribute)
* provider (attribute)
* algorithm (attribute)
* keyStore (element)

keyPassword::
The optional password for recovering/accessing the private key in the
key store.  This is typically the password for the private key in the
configured key store; however, in some cases, such as when using
PKCS#11, the key password may be provided through other means and is
omitted entirely in this configuration.
provider::
The optional provider identifier for the KeyManagerFactory used to
create the KeyManagers represented by this object's configuration. If
omitted, the default look-up behavior is used.
algorithm::
The optional algorithm name for the KeyManagerFactory used to create the
KeyManager represented by this object's configuration. See the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html[Java
Secure Socket Extension Reference Guide] for information about standard
algorithm names.
keyStore::
This optional property represents the key store that provides key
material to the key manager. This is typically configured with a key
store containing a user or server private key. In some cases, such as
when using PKCS#11, the key store is omitted entirely.

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html[Java
Secure Socket Extension Reference Guide] for information about standard
algorithm names.
trustManager::
To use an existing configured trust manager instead of using
TrustManagerFactory to get the TrustManager.
keyStore::
See <<CamelConfigurationUtilities-KeyStoreParameters>>.
This optional property represents the key store that provides key
material to the trust manager. This is typically configured with a key
store containing trusted CA certificates / public keys.  In some cases,
such as when using PKCS#11, the key store is omitted entirely.

[[CamelConfigurationUtilities-KeyStoreParameters]]
=== KeyStoreParameters

KeyStoreParameters contain the following elements:

* type (attribute)

for more information on standard names. If omitted, defaults to the default
lookup mechanism as defined by `KeyStore.getDefaultType()`
password::
The optional password for reading/opening/verifying the key store.
provider::
The optional provider identifier for the provider used to create the
KeyStores represented by this object's configuration. If omitted, the
default look-up behavior is used.
resource::
Optional property to load the key store resource from a uri. By default the class path is used, otherwise 
the uri needs to be specified. For example to use file path as a resource, the prefix file is needed (file:/path/to/keystore). 
In some cases, the resource is omitted as the key store is provided by other means. 

=== FilterParameters

algorithm identifier for the SecureRandom factory method used to create
the SecureRandom represented by this object's configuration. See
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/security/standard-names.html[Java Security Standard Algorithm Names]
for information about standard RNG algorithm names.
provider::
The optional provider identifier for the SecureRandom factory method
used to create the SecureRandom represented by this object's
configuration. If omitted, the default look-up behavior is used.

during the handshake process. This is commonly referred to as mutual
authentication, two direction SSL/TLS, or two-legged SSL/TLS.
Valid values are: NONE, WANT, REQUIRE

sessionTimeout::
This optional property defines the timeout period, in seconds, for
sessions on the server side. This setting affects both the
SSLServerSocketFactory/SSLServerSocket and the server side of the
SSLEngine.

== Examples

=== Setting Client Authentication on the Server Side

This configuration sets the server side aspects of the TLS configuration
to require client authentication during the handshake process.  This
configuration uses the default trust store and a custom key store to
provide key material for both the server and client sides of the
SSLContext.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyStoreParameters ksp = new KeyStoreParameters();
ksp.setResource("file:/users/home/server/keystore.jks");
ksp.setPassword("keystorePassword");

KeyManagersParameters kmp = new KeyManagersParameters();
kmp.setKeyStore(ksp);
kmp.setKeyPassword("keyPassword");

SSLContextServerParameters scsp = new SSLContextServerParameters();
scsp.setClientAuthentication(ClientAuthentication.REQUIRE);
SSLContextParameters scp = new SSLContextParameters();
scp.setServerParameters(scsp);
scp.setKeyManagers(kmp);

SSLContext context = scp.createSSLContext();
SSLEngine engine = scp.createSSLEngine();
-------------------------------------------------------------------

== Configuring Different Options on the Client and Server Side

In this example, both the client and server sides share the same custom
key store; however, the client side allows any supported cipher suite
while the server side will use the default cipher suite filter and
exclude any cipher suites that match the patterns:

[source,text]
----
.*_NULL_.*
.*_anon_.*
----

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyStoreParameters ksp = new KeyStoreParameters();
ksp.setResource("file:/users/home/server/keystore.jks");
ksp.setPassword("keystorePassword");

KeyManagersParameters kmp = new KeyManagersParameters();
kmp.setKeyStore(ksp);
kmp.setKeyPassword("keyPassword");

FilterParameters filter = new FilterParameters();
filter.getInclude().add(".*");

SSLContextClientParameters sccp = new SSLContextClientParameters();
sccp.setCipherSuitesFilter(filter);

SSLContextParameters scp = new SSLContextParameters();
scp.setClientParameters(sccp);
scp.setKeyManagers(kmp);

SSLContext context = scp.createSSLContext();
SSLEngine engine = scp.createSSLEngine();
-------------------------------------------------------------------

= Camel Console

The `camel-console` is available from *Camel 3.15* and newer versions.

IMPORTANT: The Camel Developer Console is intended assisting developers and can display
various information about a running Camel application. This is very handy during development and testing.
However, the Camel Developer Console is not recommended for production use.

Camel comes with a set of consoles out of the box from `camel-console` and `camel-catalog-console` JARs.
These consoles can display general information about the running JVM and the OS Environment, and of course
Camel related information such as runtime metrics of the Camel routes, and a lot more.

== Using Camel Console

The `camel-console` must be added to the classpath, and enabled either via

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.setDevConsole(true);
----

If using Camel Main / Spring Boot / Quarkus etc then the console can be enabled via
configuration:

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.dev-console-enabled = true
----

=== Dev Console and Camel Spring Boot

The Camel developer console is available in Spring Boot as an _actuator_. To enable the console
you need to add dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-console-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

To include more details such as route metrics you need to include JMX management:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-management-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

And finally you **must** enable `camel` in the exposed list of HTTP actuator endpoints in `application.properties` as shown:

[source,properties]
----
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=info,health,camel
----

The console is then available on HTTP (using default port):

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/actuator/camel
----

This will list the available consoles, and you can then call a console by its id, such as `routes`:

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/actuator/camel/routes
----

=== Dev Console and Camel JBang

The Developer Console is easily available when using xref:camel-jbang.adoc[Camel JBang],
by the `--console` argument when running Camel JBang.

For example to run a Camel route from `foo.yaml` and additional configurations from `myapp.properties` you can run as follows
and have the console started and accessible from `http://localhost:8080/q/dev`

[source,bash]
----
$ camel run foo.yaml myapp.properties --console
----

== Writing Custom Dev Consoles

To write a custom console, you need to add `camel-console` as dependency, as it comes with the
base class `AbstractDevConsole` which we extend for our console.

[source,java]
----
@DevConsole("foo")
public class FooConsole extends AbstractDevConsole {

    public FooConsole() {
        super("acme", "foo", "Foolish", "A foolish console that outputs something");
    }

    @Override
    protected String doCallText(Map<String, Object> options) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("Hello from my custom console");

        // more stuff here

        return sb.toString();
    }

    @Override
    protected JsonObject doCallJson(Map<String, Object> options) {
        JsonObject root = new JsonObject();
        root.put("message", "Hello from my custom console");

        // more stuff here

        return root;
    }

}
----

The class must be annotated with `DevConsole` and the unique id of the console (must be unique across all consoles).
In the constructor the console specifies which group, id, display title, and description to use.

The `doCallText` and `doCallJson` methods is responsible for gathering the information the console should output.

If the console does not support either text or json output, then the methods can return `null`,
and override the `supportMediaType` method and return `true` for the media-type that are supported.

=== Supported Media Types

A console can support any of, or all of the following types:

- TEXT
- JSON

The intention for `TEXT` is to be plain/text based that can be outputted in CLI and other low-level tools.

For `JSON` then the intention is the console outputs a json dataset with key/value pairs that
holds the information, which can be displayed in a custom fashion such as in a web browser, or IDE tool such as VSCode.

=== Maven Configuration

To make Camel able to discover custom dev consoles, then the xref:camel-component-maven-plugin.adoc[came-component-maven-plugin]
must be used, such as:

[source,xml]

= Camel Kubernetes plugin

This plugin helps you to get started with running Camel applications on Kubernetes.
Please make sure to meet these prerequisites for running Camel integrations on Kubernetes:

* Install a Kubernetes command line tooling (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl])
* Connect to a running Kubernetes cluster where you want to run the Camel integration

You can connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster or set up a local cluster.
To set up a local Kubernetes cluster, you have a variety of options.

* https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/[Kind]
* https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[Minikube]

Camel JBang is able to interact with any of these Kubernetes platforms (remote or local).

Running Camel routes on Kubernetes is quite simple with Camel JBang.
In fact, you can develop and test your Camel route locally with Camel JBang and then promote the same source to running it as an integration on Kubernetes.

The Camel JBang Kubernetes functionality is provided as a command plugin.
This means you need to enable the `kubernetes` plugin first to use the subcommands in Camel JBang.

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin add kubernetes
----

You should see the `kubernetes` plugin listed as an installed plugin.

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin get
----

[source,bash]
----
 NAME        COMMAND     DEPENDENCY                                      DESCRIPTION
 kubernetes  kubernetes  org.apache.camel:camel-jbang-plugin-kubernetes  Run Camel applications on Kubernetes
----

Now Camel JBang is able to run the subcommands offered by the plugin.
You can inspect the help page to see the list of available plugin subcommands.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes --help
----

== Kubernetes export

The Kubernetes plugin works with the Camel JBang export functionality.
The project export generates a proper Maven/Gradle project following one of the available runtime types Quarkus, SpringBoot or camel-main.

In case you export the project with the Kubernetes plugin the exported project holds all information (e.g. sources, properties, dependencies, etc.) and is ready to build, push and deploy the application to Kubernetes, too.
The export generates a Kubernetes manifest (kubernetes.yml) that holds all resources (e.g. Deployment, Service, ConfigMap) required to run the application on Kubernetes.

You can create a project export with the following command.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export route.yaml --dir some/path/to/project
----

The command receives one or more source files (e.g. Camel routes), and performs the export.
As a result, you will find the Maven/Gradle project sources generated into the given project path.

The default runtime of the project is Quarkus.
You can adjust the runtime with an additional command option `--runtime=quarkus`.

If you want to run this application on Kubernetes, you need to build the container image, push it to a registry and deploy the application to Kubernetes.

TIP: The Camel JBang Kubernetes plugin provides a `run` command that combines these steps (export, container image build, push, deploy) into a single command.

You can now navigate to the generated project folder and build the project artifacts for instance with this Maven command.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
----

According to the runtime type (e.g., quarkus) defined for the export this builds and creates a Quarkus application artifact JAR in the Maven build output folder (e.g. `target/route-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`).

The option `-Dquarkus.container-image.build=true` also builds a container image that is ready for deployment to Kubernetes.
More precisely, the exported project uses the very same tooling and options as an arbitrary Quarkus/SpringBoot application would do.
This means you can easily customize the container image and all settings provided by the runtime provider (e.g., Quarkus or SpringBoot) after the export.

The Kubernetes deployment resources are automatically generated with the export, too.

You can find the Kubernetes manifest in `src/main/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml`.

For instance with the option `-Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true` uses this manifest to trigger the Kubernetes deployment as part of the Maven build.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
----

You will see the Deployment on Kubernetes shortly after this command has finished.

The Camel JBang Kubernetes export command provides several options to customize the exported project.

[width="100%",cols="1m,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|--trait-profile
|The trait profile to use for the deployment.

|--service-account
|The service account used to run the application.

|--dependency

|=======================================================================

The Kubernetes plugin export command also inherits all options from the arbitrary Camel JBang export command.

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel kubernetes export --help` for more details.

=== Kubernetes Container Health Probes

The Observability Services component is set by default in the project created by the export command, then the health path probes are prefixed with the `/observe` endpoint, regardless if they are Quarkus or Spring Boot.

These are the HTTP Container probe endpoints.

For Quarkus.
[source]
----
/observe/health/live
/observe/health/ready
/observe/health/started
----

For Spring Boot (there is no startup probe)
[source]
----
/observe/health/liveness
/observe/health/readiness
----

Note that these container probes are generated by jkube plugin, when you run the `k8s:resource` to generate the manifests in the `target/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml`.

You can export to a project and manually remove the `camel-observability-services` artifact from the `pom.xml`.

== Kubernetes manifest options

The Kubernetes manifest (kubernetes.yml) describes all resources to successfully run the application on Kubernetes.
The manifest usually holds the deployment, a service definition, config maps and much more.

You can use several options on the `export` command to customize this manifest with the traits.
The trait concept was born out of Camel K, and the Camel K operator uses the traits to configure the Kubernetes resources that are managed by an integration.
You can use the same options to also customize the Kubernetes manifest that is generated as part of the project export.

The configuration of the traits is used by the given order:

1. Use the `--trait` command options values
2. Any annotation starting with the prefix `trait.camel.apache.org/*`
3. Any properties from the specific configuration `application-<profile>.properties` for the profile defined by the command option `--profile` with the prefix `camel.jbang.trait.*`
4. Any properties from the default configuration `application.properties` with the prefix `camel.jbang.trait.*`

=== Container trait options

The container specification is part of the Kubernetes Deployment resource and describes the application container image, exposed ports and health probes, for example.

The container trait is able to customize the container specification with the following options:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| container.port
| int
| To configure a different port exposed by the container (default `8080`).

| container.port-name
| string
| To configure a different port name for the port exposed by the container. It defaults to `http` only when the `expose` parameter is true.

| container.service-port
| int
| To configure under which service port the container port is to be exposed (default `80`).

| container.service-port-name
| string
| To configure under which service port name the container port is to be exposed (default `http`).

| container.name
| string
| The application container name.

| container.image
| string
| The application container image to use for the Deployment.

| container.image-pull-policy
| PullPolicy
| The pull policy: Always\|Never\|IfNotPresent

| container.image-pull-secrets
| string[]
| The pull secrets for private registries

| container.request-cpu
| string
| The minimum amount of CPU required.

| container.request-memory
| string
| The minimum amount of memory required.

| container.limit-cpu
| string
| The maximum amount of CPU required.

| container.limit-memory
| string
| The maximum amount of memory required.

|===

The syntax to specify container trait options is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait container.[key]=[value]
----

You may specify these options with the export command to customize the container specification.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait container.name=my-container --trait container.port=8088 --trait container.imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent --trait container.request-cpu=0.005 --trait container.request-memory=100Mi
----

This results in the following container specification in the Deployment resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  name: sample
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        camel.apache.org/integration: sample
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/sample:1.0-SNAPSHOT #<1>
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent #<2>
        name: my-container #<3>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8088 #<4>
          name: http
          protocol: TCP
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 100Mi
            cpu: '0.005'
----
<1> Container image running the application
<2> Customized image pull policy
<3> Custom container name
<4> Custom container port exposed

=== Labels and annotations

You may need to add labels or annotations to the generated Kubernetes resources.
By default, the generated resources will have the label `camel.apache.org/integration` set to the exported project name.

You can add labels and annotations with these options on the export command:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --annotation [key]=[value] --label [key]=[value]
----

.Example

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --annotation project.team=camel-experts
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    project.team: camel-experts #<1>
  labels:
    camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  name: sample
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        camel.apache.org/integration: sample
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/sample:1.0-SNAPSHOT
        name: sample
----
<1> Custom deployment annotation

=== Environment variables

The environment trait is there to set environment variables on the container specification.

The environment trait provides the following configuration options:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| environment.vars
| []string
| A list of environment variables to be added to the integration container.
The syntax is KEY=VALUE, e.g., `MY_VAR="my value"`.
These take precedence over the previously defined environment variables.

|===

The syntax to specify environment trait options is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait environment.[key]=[value]
----

There is also a shortcut option `--env` that you can use.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --env [key]=[value]
----

.Example
[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait environment.vars=MY_ENV=foo --env FOO_ENV=bar
----

This results in the following container specification in the Deployment resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  name: sample
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        camel.apache.org/integration: sample
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/sample:1.0-SNAPSHOT
        name: sample
        env: #<1>
          - name: MY_ENV
            value: foo
          - name: FOO_ENV
            value: bar
----
<1> Environment variables set in the container specification

=== Service trait options

The Service trait enhances the Kubernetes manifest with a Service resource so that the application can be accessed by other components in the same namespace.
The service resource exposes the application with a protocol (e.g., TCP/IP) on a given port and uses either `ClusterIP`, `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` type.

The Camel JBang plugin automatically inspects the Camel routes for exposed Http services and adds the service resource when applicable.
This means when one of the Camel routes exposes a Http service (for instance by using the `platform-http` component) the Kubernetes manifest also creates a Kubernetes Service resource besides the arbitrary Deployment.

You can customize the generated Kubernetes service resource with trait options:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| service.type
| string
| The type of service to be used, either 'ClusterIP', 'NodePort' or 'LoadBalancer'.

| container.service-port
| int
| To configure under which service port the container port is to be exposed (default `80`).

| container.service-port-name
| string
| To configure under which service port name the container port is to be exposed (default `http`).

|===

=== Knative service trait options

https://knative.dev/docs/serving/[Knative serving] defines a set of resources on Kubernetes to handle Serverless workloads with automatic scaling and scale-to-zero functionality.

When Knative serving is available on the target Kubernetes cluster, you may want to use the Knative service resource instead of an arbitrary Kubernetes service resource.
The Knative service trait will create such a resource as part of the Kubernetes manifest.

NOTE: The `knative-service` trait is disabled by default, you need to enable the Knative service trait with `--trait knative-service.enabled=true` option. Otherwise, the Camel JBang export will always create an arbitrary Kubernetes service resource.

NOTE: If you enable the knative-service trait and deploys to minikube and uses the docker builder to build the container image in the minikube registry addon, it's likely the container image published won't contain the digest value, and https://knative.dev/docs/serving/configuration/deployment/#skipping-tag-resolution[knative-serving has a verification to check the image digest], so the pod will fail to start with the error message `failed to resolve image to digest`, so for development purposes the kubernetes plugin will skip this validation by adding the property `registries-skipping-tag-resolving: localhost:5000` to the `configmap/config-deployment` in `knative-serving` namespace, if you want to disable this automatic setting, you can set the `--disable-auto` parameter to disable the automatic cluster configuration, however disabling it won't set other automatic configuration for the cluster. You may also want to manually set that property, so this plugin won't set it even with the automatic cluster detection.

WARN: Currently knative-service doesn't work in OpenShift, work is underway to fix it.


The trait offers following options for customization:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| knative-service.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property.

| knative-service.annotations
| map[string]string
| The annotations added to route.
This can be used to set knative service-specific annotations
CLI usage example: -t "knative-service.annotations.'haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance'=true"

| knative-service.class
| string
| Configures the Knative autoscaling class property (e.g., to set `hpa.autoscaling.knative.dev` or `kpa.autoscaling.knative.dev` autoscaling).

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

| knative-service.autoscaling-metric
| string
| Configures the Knative autoscaling metric property (e.g., to set `concurrency` based or `cpu` based autoscaling).

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

| knative-service.autoscaling-target
| int
| Sets the allowed concurrency level or CPU percentage (depending on the autoscaling metric) for each Pod.

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

| knative-service.min-scale
| int
| The minimum number of Pods that should be running at any time for the integration. It's **zero** by default, meaning that
the integration is scaled down to zero when not used for a configured amount of time.

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

| knative-service.max-scale
| int
| An upper bound for the number of Pods that can be running in parallel for the integration.
Knative has its own cap value that depends on the installation.

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

| knative-service.rollout-duration
| string
| Enables to gradually shift traffic to the latest Revision and sets the rollout duration.
It's disabled by default and must be expressed as a Golang `time.Duration` string representation,
rounded to a second precision.

| knative-service.visibility
| string
| Setting `cluster-local`, Knative service becomes a private service.
Specifically, this option applies the `networking.knative.dev/visibility` label to Knative service.

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

| knative-service.timeout-seconds
| int
| The maximum duration in seconds that the request instance is allowed to respond to a request. This field propagates to the integration Pod’s terminationGracePeriodSeconds.

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

|===

=== Connecting to Knative

The previous section described how the exported Apache Camel application can leverage the Knative service resource with auto-scaling as part of the deployment to Kubernetes.

Apache Camel also provides a Knative component that makes you easily interact with https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/[Knative eventing] and https://knative.dev/docs/serving/[Knative serving].

The Knative component enables you to exchange data with the Knative eventing broker and other Knative services deployed on Kubernetes.
The Camel JBang Kubernetes plugin provides some autoconfiguration options when connecting with the Knative component.
The export command assists you in configuring both the Knative component and the Kubernetes manifest for connecting to Knative resources on the Kubernetes cluster.

You can configure the Knative component with the Knative trait.

NOTE: The `knative` trait is disabled by default, you need to enable the Knative trait with `--trait knative.enabled=true` option.

The trait offers the following options for customization:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| knative.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. (default: true)

| knative.configuration
| string
| Can be used to inject a Knative complete configuration in JSON format

| knative.channel-sinks
| []string
| List of channels used as destination of camel routes. Can contain simple channel names or full Camel URIs.

Refer to the Knative documentation for more information.

| knative.channel-sources
| []string
| List of channels used as the source of camel routes. Can contain simple channel names or full Camel URIs.

| knative.endpoint-sinks
| []string
| List of endpoints used as destination of camel routes. Can contain simple endpoint names or full Camel URIs.

| knative.endpoint-sources
| []string
| List of endpoints used as sources of camel routes. Can contain simple endpoint names or full Camel URIs.

| knative.event-sinks
| []string
| List of endpoints used as destination of integration routes. Can contain simple endpoint names or full Camel URIs.

| knative.event-sources
| []string
| List of event types that the integration will be subscribed to. Can contain simple event types or full Camel URIs (to use a specific broker different from "default").

| knative.sink-binding
| bool
| Allows binding the integration to a sink via a Knative SinkBinding resource. This can be used when the integration targets a single sink. It’s enabled by default when the integration targets a single sink (except when the integration is owned by a Knative source).

| knative.filters
| []string
| Sets filter attributes on the event stream (such as event type, source, subject and so on). A list of key-value pairs that represent filter attributes and its values. The syntax is KEY=VALUE, e.g., source="my.source". Filter attributes get set on the Knative trigger that is being created as part of this integration.

| knative.filter-event-type
| bool
| Enables the default filtering for the Knative trigger using the event type If this is true, the created Knative trigger uses the event type as a filter on the event stream when no other filter criteria is given. (default: true)

|===


=== Knative trigger

The concept of a Knative trigger allows you to consume events from the https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/[Knative eventing] broker.
In case your Camel route uses the Knative component as a consumer you may need to create a trigger in Kubernetes
to connect your Camel application with the Knative broker.

The Camel JBang Kubernetes plugin is able to automatically create this trigger for you.

NOTE: The `knative` trait is disabled by default, you need to enable the Knative trait with `--trait knative.enabled=true` option.

The following Camel route uses the Knative event component and references a Knative broker by its name.
The plugin inspects the code and automatically generates the Knative trigger as part of the Kubernetes manifest that is used
to run the Camel application on Kubernetes.

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: knative:event/camel.evt.type?name=my-broker
    steps:
      - to: log:info
----

The route consumes Knative events of type `camel.evt.type`.
If you export this route with the Camel JBang Kubernetes plugin, you will see a Knative trigger being generated as part of the Kubernetes manifest (kubernetes.yml).

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export knative-route.yaml
----

The generated export project can be deployed to Kubernetes, and as part of the deployment, the trigger is automatically created so the application can start consuming events.

The generated trigger looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: my-broker-knative-route-camel-evt-type
spec:
  broker: my-broker
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: camel.evt.type
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      name: knative-route
    uri: /events/camel-evt-type
----

The trigger uses a default filter on the event type CloudEvents attribute and calls the Camel application via the exposed Kubernetes service resource.

The Camel application is automatically configured to expose an Http service so incoming events are handed over to the Camel route.
You can review the Knative service resource configuration that makes Camel configure the Knative component.
The configuration has been automatically created in `src/main/resources/knative.json` in the exported project.

Here is an example of the generated `knative.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "resources" : [ {
    "name" : "camel-event",
    "type" : "event",
    "endpointKind" : "source",
    "path" : "/events/camel-event",
    "objectApiVersion" : "eventing.knative.dev/v1",
    "objectKind" : "Broker",
    "objectName" : "my-broker",
    "reply" : false
  } ]
}
----

The exported project has everything configured to run the application on Kubernetes.
Of course, you need Knative eventing installed on your target cluster, and you need to have a Knative broker named `my-broker` available in the target namespace.

Now you can just deploy the application using the Kubernetes manifest and see the Camel route consuming events from the broker.

=== Knative channel subscription

Knative channels represent another form of producing and consuming events from the Knative broker.
Instead of using a trigger, you can create a subscription for a Knative channel to consume events.

NOTE: The `knative` trait is disabled by default, you need to enable the Knative trait with `--trait knative.enabled=true` option.

The Camel route that connects to a Knative channel in order to receive events looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: knative:channel/my-channel
    steps:
      - to: log:info
----

The Knative channel is referenced by its name.
The Camel JBang Kubernetes plugin will inspect your code to automatically create a channel subscription as part of the Kubernetes manifest.
You just need to export the Camel route as usual.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export knative-route.yaml
----

The code inspection recognizes the Knative component that references the Knative channel, and the subscription automatically becomes part of the exported Kubernetes manifest.

Here is an example subscription that has been generated during the export:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: my-channel-knative-route
spec:
  channel:
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Channel
    name: my-channel
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      name: knative-route
    uri: /channels/my-channel
----

The subscription connects the Camel application with the channel, so each event on the channel is sent to the Kubernetes service resource that also has been created as part of the Kubernetes manifest.

The Camel Knative component uses a service resource configuration internally to create the proper Http service.
You can review the Knative service resource configuration that makes Camel configure the Knative component.
The configuration has been automatically created in `src/main/resources/knative.json` in the exported project.

Here is an example of the generated `knative.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "resources" : [ {
    "name" : "my-channel",
    "type" : "channel",
    "endpointKind" : "source",
    "path" : "/channels/my-channel",
    "objectApiVersion" : "messaging.knative.dev/v1",
    "objectKind" : "Channel",
    "objectName" : "my-channel",
    "reply" : false
  } ]
}
----

Assuming that you have Knative eventing installed on your cluster and that you have set up the Knative channel `my-channel` you can start consuming events right away.
The deployment of the exported project uses the Kubernetes manifest to create all required resources, including the Knative subscription.

=== Knative sink binding

When connecting to a Knative resource (Broker, Channel, Service) in order to produce events for Knative eventing you probably want to use a `SinkBinding` that resolves the URL to the Knative resource for you.
The sink binding is a Kubernetes resource that makes Knative eventing automatically inject the resource URL into your Camel application on startup.
The Knative URL injection uses environment variables (`K_SINK`, `K_CE_OVERRIDES`) on your deployment.
The Knative eventing operator will automatically resolve the Knative resource (e.g. a Knative broker URL) and inject the value so your application does not need to know the actual URL when deploying.

The Camel JBang Kubernetes plugin leverages the sink binding concept for all routes that use the Knative component as an output.

NOTE: The `knative` trait is disabled by default, you need to enable the Knative trait with `--trait knative.enabled=true` option.

The following route produces events on a Knative broker:

[source, yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: timer:tick
    steps:
      - setBody:
          constant: Hello Camel !!!
      - to: knative:event/camel.evt.type?name=my-broker
----

The route produces events of type `camel.evt.type` and pushes the events to the broker named `my-broker`.
At this point, the actual Knative broker URL is unknown.
The sink binding is going to resolve the URL and inject its value at deployment time using the `K_SINK` environment variable.

The Camel JBang Kubernetes plugin export automatically inspects such a route and automatically creates the sink binding resource for us.
The sink binding is part of the exported Kubernetes manifest and is created on the cluster as part of the deployment.

A sink binding resource created by the export command looks like follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export knative-route.yaml
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
kind: SinkBinding
metadata:
  finalizers:
    - sinkbindings.sources.knative.dev
  name: knative-route
spec:
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: my-broker
  subject:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: knative-route
----

In addition to creating the sink binding, the Camel JBang plugin also takes care of configuring the Knative Camel component.
The Knative component uses a configuration file that you can find in `src/main/resources/knative.json`.
As you can see the configuration uses the `K_SINK` injected property placeholder as a broker URL.

[source,json]
----
{
  "resources" : [ {
    "name" : "camel-evt-type",
    "type" : "event",
    "endpointKind" : "sink",
    "url" : "{{k.sink}}",
    "objectApiVersion" : "eventing.knative.dev/v1",
    "objectKind" : "Broker",
    "objectName" : "my-broker",
    "reply" : false
  } ]
}
----

As soon as the Kubernetes deployment for the exported project has started the sink binding will inject the `K_SINK` environment variable so that the Camel applicaiton is ready to send events to the Knative broker.

The sink binding concept works for Knative Broker, Channel and Service resources.
You just reference the resource by its name in your Camel route when sending data to the Knative component as an output of the route (`to("knative:event|channel|endpoint/<resource-name>")`).

=== Mount trait options

The mount trait is able to configure volume mounts on the Deployment resource in order to inject data from Kubernetes resources such as config maps or secrets.

There are also shortcut options like `--volume`, `--config` and `--resource` for the mount trait.
These options are described in more detail in the next section.
For now let's have a look into the pure mount trait configuration options.

The mount trait provides the following configuration options:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| mount.configs
| []string
| A list of configuration pointing to configmap/secret.
The configurations are expected to be UTF-8 resources as they are processed by runtime Camel Context and tried to be parsed as property files.
They are also made available on the classpath to ease their usage directly from the Route.
Syntax: [configmap\|secret]:name[/key], where name represents the resource name and key optionally represents the resource key to be filtered

| mount.resources
| []string
| A list of resources (text or binary content) pointing to a configmap/secret.
The resources are expected to be any resource type (text or binary content).
The destination path can be either a default location or any path specified by the user.
Syntax: [configmap\|secret]:name[/key][@path], where name represents the resource name, key optionally represents the resource key to be filtered and path represents the destination path

| mount.volumes
| []string
| A list of Persistent Volume Claims to be mounted. Syntax: [pvcname:/container/path]

|===

The syntax to specify mount trait options is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait mount.[key]=[value]
----

.Example
[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait mount.configs=configmap:my-data --trait mount.volumes=my-pvc:/container/path
----

This results in the following container specification in the Deployment resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  name: sample
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        camel.apache.org/integration: sample
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/sample:1.0-SNAPSHOT
          name: sample
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/camel/conf.d/_configmaps/my-data #<1>
              name: my-data
              readOnly: true
            - mountPath: /container/path #<2>
              name: my-pvc
              readOnly: false
      volumes:
        - name: my-data #<3>
          configMap:
            name: my-data
        - name: my-pvc #<4>
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: my-pvc
----
<1> The config map `my-data` mounted into the container with default mount path for configurations
<2> The volume mounted into the container with given path
<3> The config map reference as volume spec
<4> The persistent volume claim `my-pvc`

=== ConfigMaps, volumes and secrets

In the previous section, we have seen how to mount volumes, configs, and resources into the container.

The Kubernetes export command provides some shortcut options for adding configmaps and secrets as volume mounts.
The syntax is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --config [key]=[value] --resource [key]=[value] --volume [key]=[value]
----

The options expect the following syntax:

[cols="2m,5a"]
|===
|Option | Syntax

| config
| Add a runtime configuration from a ConfigMap or a Secret (syntax: [configmap\|secret]:name[/key], where name represents the configmap or secret name and key optionally represents the configmap or secret key to be filtered).

| resource
| Add a runtime resource from a Configmap or a Secret (syntax: [configmap\|secret]:name[/key][@path], where name represents the configmap or secret name, key optionally represents the configmap or secret key to be filtered and the path represents the destination path).

| volume
| Mount a volume into the integration container, for instance "--volume pvcname:/container/path".

|===

.Example
[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --config secret:my-credentials  --resource configmap:my-data --volume my-pvc:/container/path
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    camel.apache.org/integration: sample
  name: sample

    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/sample:1.0-SNAPSHOT
          name: sample
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/camel/conf.d/_secrets/my-credentials
              name: my-credentials #<1>
              readOnly: true
            - mountPath: /etc/camel/resources.d/_configmaps/my-data
              name: my-data #<2>
              readOnly: true
            - mountPath: /container/path
              name: my-pvc #<3>
              readOnly: false
      volumes:
        - name: my-credentials #<4>
          secret:
            secretName: my-credentials
        - name: my-data #<5>
          configMap:
            name: my-data
        - name: my-pvc #<6>
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: my-pvc
----
<1> The secret configuration volume mount
<2> The config map resource volume mount
<3> The volume mount
<4> The secret configuration volume
<5> The config map resource volume
<6> The persistent volume claim volume

The trait volume mounts follow some best practices in specifying the mount paths in the container. Configurations and resources, secrets, and configmaps do use different paths in the container. The Camel application is automatically configured to read these paths as resource folders, so you can use the mounted data in the Camel routes via classpath reference, for instance.

=== Ingress trait options

The ingress trait enhances the Kubernetes manifest with an Ingress resource to expose the application to the outside world. This requires the presence in the Kubernetes manifest of a Service Resource.

The ingress trait provides the following configuration options:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| ingress.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property (default `false`).

| ingress.annotations
| map[string]string
| The annotations added to the ingress. This can be used to set controller-specific annotations, e.g., when using the https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md[NGINX Ingress controller].

| ingress.host
| string
| To configure the host exposed by the ingress.

| ingress.path
| string
| To configure the path exposed by the ingress (default `/`).

| ingress.pathType
| string
| To configure the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types[path type] exposed by the ingress. One of Exact, Prefix, ImplementationSpecific (default to Prefix).

| ingress.auto
| bool
| To automatically add an Ingress Resource whenever the route uses an HTTP endpoint consumer (default `true`).

| ingress.tls-hosts
| []string
| To configure specific hosts exposed through SNI TLS extension by the ingess.

| ingress.tls-secret-name
| string
| To indicate the secret containing the TLS private key and certificate to use for TLS.

|===

The syntax to specify container trait options is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait ingress.[key]=[value]
----

You may specify these options with the export command to customize the Ingress Resource specification.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait ingress.enabled=true --trait ingress.host=example.com --trait ingress.path=/sample(/|$)(.*) --trait ingress.pathType=ImplementationSpecific --trait ingress.annotations=nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target=/\$2 --trait ingress.annotations=nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex=true
----


This results in the following container specification in the Ingress resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations: #<1>
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: sample

        pathType: ImplementationSpecific #<4>


----
<1> Custom annotations configuration for ingress behavior
<2> Service port name
<3> Custom ingress backend path
<4> Custom ingress backend path type

=== Route trait options

The Route trait enhances the Kubernetes manifest with a Route resource to expose the application to the outside world. This requires the presence in the Kubernetes manifest of a Service Resource.

NOTE: You need to enable the OpenShift profile trait with `--trait-profile=openshift` option.

The Route trait provides the following configuration options:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| route.enabled
| bool
| Can be used to enable or disable a trait. All traits share this common property (default `false`).

| route.annotations
| map[string]string
| The annotations added to the route. This can be used to set https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/networking/routes/route-configuration.html#nw-route-specific-annotations_route-configuration[openshift route specific annotations] options.

| route.host
| string
| To configure the host exposed by the route.

| route.tls-termination
| string
| The TLS termination type, like `edge`, `passthrough` or `reencrypt`. Refer to the OpenShift route documentation for additional information.

| route.tls-certificate
| string
| The TLS certificate contents or file (`file:absolute.path`). Refer to the OpenShift route documentation for additional information.

| route.tls-key
| string
| The TLS certificate key contents or file (`file:absolute.path`). Refer to the OpenShift route documentation for additional information.

| route.tls-ca-certificate
| string
| The TLS CA certificate contents or file (`file:absolute.path`). Refer to the OpenShift route documentation for additional information.

| route.tls-destination-ca-certificate
| string
| The destination CA contents or file (`file:absolute.path`). The destination CA certificate provides the contents of the CA certificate of the final destination. When using reencrypt termination, this file should be provided to have routers use it for health checks on the secure connection. If this field is not specified, the router may provide its own destination CA and perform hostname validation using the short service name (service.namespace.svc), which allows infrastructure generated certificates to automatically verify. Refer to the OpenShift route documentation for additional information.


| route.tls-insecure-edge-termination-policy
| string
| To configure how to deal with insecure traffic, e.g. `Allow`, `Disable` or `Redirect` traffic. Refer to the OpenShift route documentation for additional information.

|===

The syntax to specify container trait options is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait route.[key]=[value]
----

You may specify these options with the export command to customize the Route Resource specification.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait-profile=openshift -t route.enabled=true --trait route.host=example.com -t route.tls-termination=edge -t route.tls-certificate=file:/tmp/tls.crt -t route.tls-key=file:/tmp/tls.key
----


This results in the following container specification in the Route resource.

=== OpenApi specifications

You can mount OpenAPI specifications to the application container with this trait.

The openapi trait provides the following configuration options:

[cols="2m,1m,5a"]
|===
|Property | Type | Description

| openapi.configmaps
| []string
| The configmaps holding the spec of the OpenAPI

|===

The syntax to specify openapi trait options is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait openapi.[key]=[value]
----

.Example
[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --trait openapi.configmaps=configmap:my-spec
----

TIP: There is also a shortcut option `--open-api=configmap:my-configmap`.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes export Sample.java --open-api configmap:[name-of-configmap]
----

This results in the following container specification in the Deployment resource.

<2> Volume referencing the config map holding the OpenAPI specification

== Deploy to OpenShift

By default, the Kubernetes manifest is suited for plain Kubernetes platforms.
In case you are targeting OpenShift as a platform you may want to leverage special resources such as Route, ImageStream or BuildConfig.

You can set the `cluster-type=openshift` option on the export command to tell the Kubernetes plugin to create a Kubernetes manifest specifically suited for OpenShift.

Also, the default image builder is S2I for OpenShift clusters.
This means by setting the cluster type, you will automatically switch from default Jib to S2I.
Of course, you can tell the plugin to use Jib with `--image-builder=jib` option.
The image may then get pushed to an external registry (docker.io or quay.io) so OpenShift can pull as part of the deployment in the cluster.

TIP: When using S2I, you may need to explicitly set the `--image-group` option to the project/namespace name in the OpenShift cluster.
This is because S2I will push the container image to an image repository that uses the OpenShift project/namespace name as part of the image coordinates in the registry: `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/<project name>/<name>:<tag>`

When using S2I as an image build option, the Kubernetes manifest also contains an ImageStream and BuildConfig resource.
Both resources are automatically added/removed when creating/deleting the deployment with the Camel Kubernetes JBang plugin.

== Kubernetes run

The run command combines several steps into one single command.
The command performs a project export to a temporary folder, builds the project artifacts as well as the container images, pushes the image to an image registry and finally performs the deployment to Kubernetes using the generated Kubernetes manifest (`kubernetes.yml`).

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes run route.yaml --image-registry=kind
----

When connecting to a local Kubernetes cluster, you may need to specify the image registry where the application container image gets pushed to.
The run command is able to automatically configure the local registry when using predefined names such as `kind` or `minikube`, there is a detection mechanism to set some properties accordingly to the cluster type, currently it can auto detect Openshift and Minikube. If you want to disable the cluster detection, you have to set the `--disable-auto` cli parameter.

NOTE: When running minikube, the easiest way to push the image to the minikube container registry, is to enable the registry addon in minikube and to run `eval $(minikube docker-env)`.

Use the `--image-group` or the `--image` option to customize the container image.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes run route.yaml --image-registry=kind --image-group camel-experts
----

The command above builds and pushes the container image: `localhost:5001/camel-experts/route:1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes run route.yaml --image quay.io/camel-experts/demo-app:1.0
----

The `--image` option forces the container image group, name, version as well as the image registry.

=== Customize the Kubernetes manifest

The `run` command provides the same options to customize the Kubernetes manifest as the `export` command.
You may want to add environment variables, mount secrets and configmaps, adjust the exposed service and many other things with trait options as described in the export command section.

=== Auto reload with `--dev` option

The `--dev` option runs the application on Kubernetes and automatically adds a file watcher to listen for changes on the Camel route source files.
In case the sources get changed, the process will automatically perform a rebuild and redeployment.
The command constantly prints the logs to the output, so you may see the changes directly being applied to the Kubernetes deployment.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes run route.yaml --image-registry=kind --dev
----

You need to terminate the process to stop the dev mode.
This automatically removes the Kubernetes deployment from the cluster on shutdown.

NOTE: On macOS hosts, the file watch mechanism is known to be much slower and less stable compared to using the `--dev` option on other operating systems like Linux.
This is due to limited native file operations on macOS for Java processes.

== Show logs

To inspect the log output of a running deployment call:

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes logs --name=route
----

The command connects to the running integration Pod on the cluster and streams the log output.
Just terminate the process to stop printing the logs.

The `--name` option should point to a previously exported project (either via `run` or `export` command).

== Delete deployments

Of course, you may also delete a deployment from the cluster.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes delete --name=route
----

Use the `--name` option to select a previously exported project (either via `run` or `export` command).
The delete operation will remove all resources defined in the Kubernetes manifest.

If you used the `--cluster-type` option to create your project (either via `run` or `export` command) you will need to use it as well for the delete operation.

[source,bash]
----
camel kubernetes delete --name=route --cluster-type=openshift
----

== Minikube deployment tips and troubleshooting

To run a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube for development purposes.
Here are some tips from users that have been using this.

The following steps have been known to be working with Camel 4.8.1+:

1. `minikube start --addons registry --driver=docker`
2. `eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)`
3. `camel kubernetes run demo.camel.yaml --cluster-type=minikube --build-property=quarkus.kubernetes.image-pull-policy=Never`

Most important `--build-property=quarkus.kubernetes.image-pull-policy=Never` without that it is not working, which is not clear from the current Minikube docs.

The following steps have been known to be working with Camel 4.9+:

1. `minikube start --addons registry --driver=docker`
2. `eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)`
3. `camel kubernetes run demo.camel.yaml --cluster-type=minikube --build-property=quarkus.kubernetes.image-pull-policy=Never --trait container.image-push=true --image-registry '$(kubectl -n kube-system get service registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')' --image-builder=docker`

The following steps have been known to be working with Camel 4.10+:

1. `minikube start --addons registry --driver=docker`
2. `eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)`
3. `camel kubernetes run demo.camel.yaml --cluster-type=minikube --build-property=quarkus.kubernetes.image-pull-policy=Never --image-registry "$(kubectl -n kube-system get service registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')" --image-builder=docker`

Note that Docker multi-platform build is used. It requires to have followed these https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#build-multi-platform-images[Docker requirements].

= Camel JBang

A JBang-based Camel app for easily running Camel routes.

== Installation

First, you must install https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang], which is used for launching Camel.
See instructions on https://www.jbang.dev/download/[JBang] how to download and install.

After JBang is installed, you can verify JBang is working by executing the following command from a command shell:

[source,bash]
----
jbang version
----

Which should output the version of JBang.

To make it easier to use Camel JBang, then install the following:

[source,bash]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

This will install Apache Camel as the `camel` command within JBang, meaning that you can run Camel from the command line
by just executing `camel` (see more next).

Note: It requires access to the internet, in case of using a proxy, please ensure that the proxy is configured for your system.
If Camel JBang is not working with your current configuration,
please look to https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/configuration.html#proxy-configuration[Proxy configuration in JBang documentation].

== Container Image

There is also a container image available in https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/camel-jbang/[Dockerhub]

[source,bash]
----
docker pull apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0
----

or

[source,bash]
----
podman pull apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0
----

Once you have the image in your local registry, you can run all the commands listed below by simple doing:

[source,bash]
----
docker run apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 version
----

or

[source,bash]
----
podman run apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 version
----

This will print the following result:

[source,bash]
----
Camel JBang version: 4.4.0
----

So running a simple route will be as easy as doing the following:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -v .:/integrations apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 run /integrations/example.yaml
----

or

[source,bash]
----
podman run -v .:/integrations apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 run /integrations/example.yaml
----

== Using Camel JBang

The Camel JBang supports multiple commands. Running the command below will print all of them:

[source,bash]
----
camel --help
----

TIP: The first time you run this command, it may cause dependencies to be cached, therefore taking a few extra seconds to run. If you are already using JBang and you get first time to run errors such as `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: "org/apache/camel/dsl/jbang/core/commands/CamelJBangMain"` you may try clearing the JBang cache and re-install again.

All the commands support the `--help` and will display the appropriate help if that flag is provided.

=== Enable shell completion

Camel JBang provides shell completion for bash and zsh out of the box. To enable shell completion for Camel JBang, run:

[source,bash]
----
source <(camel completion)
----

To make it permanent, run:

[source,bash]
----
echo 'source <(camel completion)' >> ~/.bashrc
----

== REPL loop

A simple read-eval-print loop is available, you can launch it with:

[source, bash]
----
camel shell
----

== Creating and running Camel routes

You can create a new basic routes with the `init` command.

For example, to create an XML route, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
camel init cheese.xml
----

Which creates the file `cheese.xml` (in the current directory) with a sample route.

To run the file, you do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run cheese.xml
----

NOTE: You can create and run any of the supported xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] in Camel such as YAML, XML, Java, Groovy.

To create a new .java route, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java
----

When using the init command, then Camel will by default create the file in the current directory.
However, you can use
the `--directory` option to create the file in the specified directory.
For example, to create in a folder
named `_foobar_` you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java --directory=foobar
----

=== Running Routes from multiple files

You can run more than one file, for example, to run two YAML files you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml two.yaml
----

You can also mix different xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] such as YAML and Java:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml hello.java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the YAML files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *.yaml
----

Or you can run all files starting with foo*

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo*
----

And to run everything

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

TIP: The run goal can also detect files that are `properties`, such as `application.properties`.

=== Running a Maven or Gradle based project

Camel JBang is intended for flat-file-based projects, where you run small integrations.
However, Camel JBang may be used as a tool for migrating existing Maven or Gradle based projects.
To make the migration easier, then JBang can do _best effort_ to run, export, or transform these projects.

For example, if you have a Maven-based project, you can execute

[source,bash]
----
camel run pom.xml
----

or for a Gradle project

[source,bash]
----
camel run build.gradle
----

Camel JBang will then scan in `src/main/java` and `src/main/resources` for files to include (recursive).

NOTE: Using `camel run pom.xml` is not intended as a fully compatible way of running an existing Maven-based project. It cannot start Quarkus or Spring Boot applications; instead, use the proper plugins/commands. The command is mainly used to migrate from old projects.

=== Running Route with user interactive prompt for placeholder values

You can create Camel integrations that makes it possible for the user to quickly enter placeholder values from command prompt.

For example, given the following route:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class foo extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("timer:java?period={{time:1000}}")
            .setBody()
                .simple("Hello Camel from {{you}}")
            .log("${body}");
    }
}
----

Then if you run this with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
----

You will have an exception on startup about the missing value
[source,text]
----
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Property with key [you] not found in properties from text: Hello Camel from {{you}}`
----

However, you can then run in prompt mode as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --prompt
----

And Camel will now prompt in the terminal for you to enter values for the placeholders:

[source,bash]
----
2023-12-15 21:46:44.218  INFO 15033 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Apache Camel (JBang) 4.7.0 is starting
2023-12-15 21:46:44.331  INFO 15033 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Using Java 17.0.5 with PID 15033. Started by davsclaus in /Users/davsclaus/workspace/deleteme/prompt
2023-12-15 21:46:45.360  INFO 15033 --- [           main] mel.cli.connector.LocalCliConnector : Management from Camel JBang enabled

2023-12-15 21:46:55.239  INFO 15033 --- [           main] el.impl.engine.AbstractCamelContext : Apache Camel 4.7.0 (foo) is starting

----

From the snippet above, Camel JBang had two prompts. First for the `time` which has a default value of `1000` so you can just press ENTER to accept the default value.
And for `you` a value must be entered, and we entered `Jack` in this example.

You may want to use this for Camel prototypes where you want the user to be able to enter custom values quickly.
Those values can of course be pre-configured in `application.properties` as well.

=== Running Route from input parameter

For very small Java routes then it is possible to provide the route as CLI argument, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --code='from("kamelet:beer-source").to("log:beer")'
----

This is very limited as the CLI argument is a bit cumbersome to use than files.

- Java DSL code is only supported
- Code wrapped in single quote, so you can use double quote in Java DSL
- Code limited to what literal values possible to provide from the terminal and JBang.
- All route(s) must be defined in a single `--code` parameter.

NOTE: Using `--code` is only usable for very quick and small prototypes.

From *Camel 4.7* onwards the `--code` parameter can also refer to a `.java` source file,
that are not wrapped in a `public class` which makes it possible to quickly try a prototype
with some Camel java based routes such as the following stored in a file named `quick.java`:

[source,java]
----
from("timer:java?period=1000")
    .setBody()
        .simple("Hello Quick Camel from ${routeId}")
    .log("${body}");
----

Then you can run this route via:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --code=quick.java
----

NOTE: You cannot use `--dev` to hot-reload this on code changes.

=== Running Routes from source directory

You can also run dev mode when running Camel with `--source-dir`, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --source-dir=mycode
----

This starts Camel where it will load the files from the _source dir_ (also subfolders).

=== Stub components that should not be active

Sometimes you need to troubleshoot an existing integration and is given some Camel code (routes).
These routes may use different components, and those components may be tricky to run as they are configured
in a custom way, or need connection to servers you may not have access to.

You can run Camel JBang by stubbing those components (or all of them).

For example, suppose you need access to a JMS broker in the given route below.

[source,java]
----
from("jms:inbox")
  .log("Incoming order")
  .to("bean:transform")
  .log("After transformation")
  .to("jms:process");
----

Then you can run this by stub the `jms` component by:

[source,bash]
----
camel run syncToDatabase.java --stub=jms
----

Then Camel will not start up the JMS component but replace it with the `stub` component, but keep the actual endpoint URIs.

You can then simulate sending messages to Camel with the `cmd send` command:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send --body='Something here'
----

Which then will send the message to the incoming endpoint in the route, i.e. `jms:inbox` which has been stubbed.

You can also stub a specific endpoint by providing the full uri, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run syncToDatabase.java --stub=jms:inbox
----

Then only the `jms:inbox` endpoint is stubbed.

TIP: You can stub multiple components separated by comma, such as `--stub=jms,sql`

Camel JBang comes with the `camel cmd stub` command that allows to list all endpoints that
has been stubbed, and also browse any messages that are currently present in their internal queues.
A stub endpoint is based on the `seda` component.

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stub
----

And to browse the messages:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stub --browse
----

=== Dev mode with live reload

You can enable dev mode that comes with live reload of the route(s) when the source file is updated (saved),
using the `--dev` options as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.yaml --dev
----

Then, while the Camel integration is running, you can update the YAML route and update when saving.

This works for all DSLs, even java, so you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --dev
----

NOTE: The live reload is meant for development purposes, and if you encounter problems with reloading
such as JVM class loading issues, then you may need to restart the integration. Java files cannot
be supported in Spring Boot runtime since they have to be recompiled to trigger a restart.

You can also run dev mode when running Camel with `--source-dir`, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --source-dir=mycode --dev
----

This starts Camel where it will load the files from the _source dir_ (also subfolders).
And in _dev mode_ then you can add new files, update existing files, and delete files, and Camel
will automatically hot-reload on the fly.

Using _source dir_ is more flexible than having to specify the files in the CLI as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run mycode/foo.java mycode/bar.java --dev
----

In this situation, then Camel will only watch and reload these two files (foo.java and bar.java).
So, for example, if you add a new file cheese.xml, then this file is not reloaded. On the other hand,
if you use `--source-dir` then any files in this directory (and subfolders) are automatic detected
and reloaded. You can also delete files to remove routes.

NOTE: You cannot use both files and source dir together.
The following is not allowed: `camel run abc.java --source-dir=mycode`.

==== Uploading files to source directory via HTTP

When running Camel JBang with `--source-dir`, `--console` and `--dev` (reloading) then you can
change the source files on-the-fly by copying, modifying or deleting the files in the source directory.

This can also be done via HTTP using the `q/upload/:filename` HTTP endpoint using PUT and DELETE verbs.

Suppose that you run Camel JBang with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --source-dir=mycode --console --dev
----

Then you can upload or modify a source file named `bar.java` you can send a PUT request via curl:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/bar.java --data-binary "@bar.java"
----

Or via:

[source,bash]
----
curl -T bar.java http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/bar.java
----

To send the data via PUT, then the file body can be included when using `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:

For example, from a CURL `--trace-ascii log.txt`:

[source,text]
----
0000: PUT /q/upload/bar.java HTTP/1.1
0021: Host: 0.0.0.0:8080
0035: User-Agent: curl/7.87.0
004e: Accept: */*
005b: Content-Length: 385
0070: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
00a1:

0000: // camel-k: language=java..import org.apache.camel.builder.Route
0040: Builder;..public class bar extends RouteBuilder {..    @Override
0080: .    public void configure() throws Exception {..        // Writ
00c0: e your routes here, for example:.        from("timer:java?period
0100: ={{time:1000}}").            .setBody().                .simple(
0140: "XXXCamel from ${routeId}").            .log("${body}");.    }.}
0180: .

0000: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

0000: content-length: 0
<= Recv header, 2 bytes (0x2)
0000:
== Info: Connection #0 to host 0.0.0.0 left intact
----

To delete one or more files, you use the DELETE verb, such as:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/bar.java
----

You can also use wildcards ('*') to delete all .java files:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/*.java
----

Or to delete everything

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/*
----

=== Developer Console

You can enable the developer console, which presents a variety of information to the developer.

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --console
----

The console is then accessible from a web browser at: http://localhost:8080/q/dev (by default).
The link is also shown in the log when Camel is starting up.

The console can give you insights into your running Camel integration, such as reporting the top
routes that takes the longest time to process messages. You can then drill down to pinpoint exactly
which individual EIPs in these routes are the slowest.

The developer console can also output the data in JSON format, which, for example, can be used by 3rd-party tooling
to scrape the information.

For example, to output the top routes via curl, you can execute:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json"  http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/dev/top/
----

And if you have `jq` installed which can format and output the JSON data in color, then do:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json"  http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/dev/top/ | jq
----

[#_using_profiles]
=== Using profiles

*Available from Camel 4.5*

Camel JBang comes with three sets of profiles

- `dev`:for development (default)
- `test`:for testing (currently same as production)
- `prod`:for production

The developer profile will pre-configure Camel JBang with a number of developer assisted features when
running Camel. For example, tracing messages during routing, additional metrics collected, and more.
This is useful during development and also enhanced the Camel JBang CLI tool.

However, you may want to run Camel JBang in a production-like scenario, which you can do with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --profile=prod
----

You can have profile-specific configuration in configuration files using the naming style `application-<profile>.properties`,
such as in the following:

- `application.properties`: common configuration that is always in use (default).
- `application-dev.properties`: developer specific configuration for  the `dev` profile.
- `application-prod.properties`: developer specific configuration for  the `prod` profile.

The profile-specific configuration will override values in the common configuration.

=== Downloading JARs over the internet

By default, Camel JBang will automatically resolve dependencies needed to run Camel, which is done
by JBang and Camel respectively. Camel itself detects at runtime if a component has a need for JARs that
are not currently available on the classpath, and can then automatically download the JARs (incl transitive).

Camel will download these JARs in the following order:

1. from local disk in `~/.m2/repository`
2. from the internet in Maven Central
3. from the internet from custom third-party Maven repositories
4. from all the repositories found in active profiles of `~/.m2/settings.xml` or a settings file specified using
`--maven-settings` option.

If you do not want Camel JBang to download over the internet, you can turn this off with `--download`, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --download=false
----

If you do not want Camel JBang to use your existing Maven settings file, you can use:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=false
----

[#_adding_custom_jars]
=== Adding custom JARs

Camel JBang will automatically detect dependencies for Camel components, languages, data formats, etc. that
from its own release. This means you often do not have to specify which JARs to use.

However, if you need to add 3rd-party custom JARs, then you can specify these with `--dep` as CLI argument in Maven
GAV syntax (`groupId:artifactId:version`), such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --dep=com.foo:acme:1.0
----

In case you need to explicit add a Camel dependency you can use a shorthand syntax (starting with `camel:` or `camel-`)
such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --dep=camel-saxon
----

You can specify multiple dependencies separated by comma:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --dep=camel-saxon,com.foo:acme:1.0
----

=== Using 3rd-party Maven repositories

Camel JBang will download from local repository first, and then online from Maven Central.
To be able to download from 3rd-party Maven repositories then you need to specify this as CLI argument,
]or in `application.properties`

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --repos=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

TIP: Multiple repositories can be separated by comma

The configuration for the 3rd-party Maven repositories can also be configured in `application.properties`
with the key `camel.jbang.repos` as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.jbang.repos=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

And when running Camel then `application.properties` is automatically loaded:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
----

However, you can also explicitly specify the properties file to use:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java application.properties
----

And even better if you specify this as a profile:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --profile=application
----

Where the profile id is the name of the properties file.


=== Configuration of Maven usage

By default, existing `~/.m2/settings.xml` file is loaded, so it is possible to alter the behaviour of Maven resolution
process. Maven settings file can provide information about Maven mirrors, credential configuration (potentially
encrypted) or active profiles, and additional repositories.

Maven repositories can use authentication and the Maven-way to configure credentials is through `<server>` elements,
like this:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
    <id>external-repository</id>
    <username>camel</username>
    <password>{SSVqy/PexxQHvubrWhdguYuG7HnTvHlaNr6g3dJn7nk=}</password>
</server>
----

While the password may be specified using plain text, it's better to configure maven master password first and then
use it to configure repository password:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn -emp
Master password: camel
{hqXUuec2RowH8dA8vdqkF6jn4NU9ybOsDjuTmWvYj4U=}
----

The above password should be added to `~/.m2/settings-security.xml` file like this:

[source,xml]
----
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{hqXUuec2RowH8dA8vdqkF6jn4NU9ybOsDjuTmWvYj4U=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
----

Then a normal password can be configured like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn -ep
Password: camel
{SSVqy/PexxQHvubrWhdguYuG7HnTvHlaNr6g3dJn7nk=}
----

Finally, such passwords can be used in `<server>/<password>` configuration.

By default, Maven reads the master password from `~/.m2/settings-security.xml` file, but we can override it.
The location of the `settings.xml` file itself can be specified as well:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=/path/to/settings.xml --maven-settings-security=/path/to/settings-security.xml
----

If you want to run Camel application without assuming any location (even `~/.m2/settings.xml`), use this option:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=false
----


=== Running routes hosted on GitHub

You can run a route hosted on GitHub using Camels xref:components:others:resourceresolver-github.adoc[GitHub] resource loader.

For example, to run one of the Camel Kamelets examples, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run github:apache:camel-kamelets-examples:jbang/hello-java/Hey.java
----

You can also use the `https` URL for GitHub. For example, you can browse the examples from a web-browser and
then copy the URL from the browser window and run the example with Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/hello-java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the groovy files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/languages/*.groovy
----

Or you can run all files starting with rou*

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/languages/rou*
----

==== Running routes from GitHub gists

Using gists from GitHub is a quick way to share small Camel routes that you can easily run.

For example, to run a gist, you can execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

A gist can contain one or more files, and Camel JBang will gather all relevant files, so a gist
can contain multiple routes, properties files, Java beans, etc.

=== Downloading routes hosted on GitHub

We have made it easy for Camel JBang to download existing examples from GitHub to local disk,
which allows for modifying the example and to run locally.

All you need to do is to copy the https link from the web browser.
For example, you can download the _dependency injection_ example by:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection
----

Then the files (not subfolders) are downloaded to the current directory.
The example can then be run locally with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also download to a new folder using the `--directory` option, for example, to download to a folder named _myproject_,
you would do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection --directory=myproject
----

You can also run in dev mode, to hot-deploy on source code changes.

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --dev
----

You can also download a single file, such as one of the Camel Kamelets examples:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/blob/main/jbang/hello-yaml/hello.camel.yaml
----

This is a groovy route, which you can run with (or use `*`):

[source,bash]
----
camel run simple.groovy
----

==== Downloading routes form GitHub gists

You can also download files from gists easily as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

This will then download the files to local disk, which you can run afterward:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also download to a new folder using the `--directory` option, for example, to download to a folder named _foobar_,
you would do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92 --directory=foobar
----

=== Using a specific Camel version

You can specify which Camel version to run as shown:

[source,bash]
----
jbang -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.18.4 camel@apache/camel [command]
----

NOTE: Older versions of Camel may not work as well with Camel JBang as the newest versions.
Starting from Camel 3.20 onwards are the versions that are recommended to be used onwards.

TIP: In Camel *3.20.3* onwards there is a `version` command, see the following section for more details.

In *Camel 3.20.2* onwards the `run` command has built-in support, using `--camel-version`,
for specifying the Camel version to use for the running Camel integration.

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --camel-version=3.18.4
----

TIP: This makes it easy to try different Camel versions, for example, when you need to reproduce an issue,
and find out how it works in a different Camel version.

You can also try bleeding-edge development by using SNAPSHOT such as:

[source,bash]
----
jbang --fresh -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.21.0-SNAPSHOT camel@apache/camel [command]
----

=== Using the version command

In *Camel 3.20.3* onwards the `version` command makes it possible to configure a specific version
of Camel to use when running or exporting. This makes it possible to use the latest Camel JBang CLI
and run integrations using an older Camel version.

[source,bash]
----
camel version
Camel JBang version: 3.20.3
----

Here Camel JBang is using version 3.20.3. Now suppose we want to run Camel integrations with version 3.18.2.

[source,bash]
----
camel version set 3.18.2
----

And you can see what Camel version has been set by:

[source,bash]
----
camel version
Camel JBang version: 3.20.3
User configuration:
    camel-version = 3.18.2
----

And when running an integration, then Camel JBang will show you the _overridden version_ when starting.

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
Running integration with the following configuration:
    --camel-version=3.18.2
2023-03-17 13:35:13.876  INFO 28451 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport        : Apache Camel (JBang) 3.18.2 is starting
...
----

IMPORTANT: You cannot use both a set version via `camel version set` and also a version specified via `--camel-version` option,
i.e., the following is not possible:

[source,bash]
----
camel version set 4.0.1
camel run * --camel-version=4.3.0
----

If you want to unset the version, you can use the `--reset` option:

[source,bash]
----
camel version set --reset
----

Then the Camel version in use will be the same version as Camel JBang.

==== Listing available Camel releases

The `version` command can also show available Camel releases by checking the Maven central repository.

NOTE: The `version list` shows the latest releases going back a few versions, at this time of writing the minimum version
is Camel 3.14. To show all Camel 3.x releases, you can specify `--from-version=3.0` and the list is longer.
The list can only go back to Camel 2.18, as we do not have all release meta-data for older releases.

You can also show Camel releases for either Spring Boot or Quarkus using the `--runtime` option, such as:

TIP: See more options with `camel version list --help`.

=== Manage plugins

Camel JBang uses a plugin concept for some of the subcommands so users can add functionality on demand.
Each provided plugin adds a list of commands to the Camel JBang command line tool.

You can list the supported plugins with

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin get --all
----

[source,text]
----
Supported plugins:

 NAME        COMMAND     DEPENDENCY                                      DESCRIPTION
 kubernetes  kubernetes  org.apache.camel:camel-jbang-plugin-kubernetes  Run Camel applications on Kubernetes
 generate    generate    org.apache.camel:camel-jbang-plugin-generate    Generate code such as DTOs
----

In case you want to enable a plugin and its functionality, you can add it as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin add <plugin-name>
----

For example to install `generate` you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin add generate
----

This adds the plugin, and all subcommands are now available for execution.

You can list the currently installed plugins with:

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin get
----

To remove a plugin from the current Camel JBang command line tooling, you can use the `plugin delete` command.

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin delete <plugin-name>
----

=== Running Pipes

Camel also supports running pipes, which represent Kubernetes custom resources following a specific CRD format (Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions).

For example, a pipe file named `joke.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
#!/usr/bin/env jbang camel@apache/camel run
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Pipe
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 2000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
    properties:
      show-headers: false
----

Can be run with camel:

[source,bash]
----
camel run joke.yaml
----

==== Binding Kamelets in a pipe

Camel JBang is able to create the Pipe custom resource for you.
You can use the `bind` command to specify a source and a sink that should be set in the pipe.
As a result, Camel JBang will create a proper Pipe custom resource for you.

The command expects a file name as command argument and provides several options to define the source and the sink that should be used in the pipe.

[source,bash]
----
camel bind joke.yaml --source chuck-norris-source --sink log-sink
----

This creates the `joke.yaml` file that represents the Pipe resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Pipe
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 5000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
----

NOTE: The bind command is able to inspect the Kamelets being used as a source and sink in order to automatically set all required properties.
In case the Kamelet defines a required property, and the user has not specified such, the command will automatically set this property with an example value.
Once the pipe resource file is generated, you can review and set the properties as you wish.

The bind command supports the following options:

[width="100%",cols="1m,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|--source
|Source (from) such as a Kamelet or Camel endpoint uri that provides data.

|--sink
|Sink (to) such as a Kamelet or Camel endpoint uri where data should be sent to.

|--step
|Add optional 1-n steps to the pipe processing. Each step represents a reference to a Kamelet of type action.

|--property
|Add a pipe property in the form of `[source,sink,error-handler,step-<n>].<key>=<value>` where `<n>` is the step number starting from 1.

|--error-handler
|Add error handler (none,log,sink:<endpoint>). Sink endpoints are expected in the format [[apigroup/]version:]kind:[namespace/]name, plain Camel URIs or Kamelet name.

|--output
|Output format generated by this command (supports: file, YAML or JSON). Default is "file".
|=======================================================================

==== Binding explicit Camel URIs

Usually, the source and sink reference a Kamelet by its name as shown in the previous section.
As an alternative, you can also just use an arbitrary Camel endpoint URI that acts as a source or sink in the pipe.

[source,bash]
----
camel bind joke.yaml --source chuck-norris-source --sink https://mycompany.com/the-service
----

As a result, the Pipe resource uses the Camel endpoints as source and sink.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Pipe
metadata:
  name: my-pipe
spec:
  source:
# ...
  sink:
    uri: https://mycompany.com/the-service # <1>
----
<1> Pipe with explicit Camel endpoint URI as sink where the data gets pushed to

=== Creating a new Kamelet

You can create a new kamelet with the `init` command by using kamelet naming convention.

For example, to create a new kamelet source, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init cheese-source.kamelet.yaml
----

This will create a basic kamelet (based on the timer source).

And to use the kamelet, you could create the following route:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "kamelet:cheese-source"
    parameters:
      period: "2000"
      message: "Hello World"
    steps:
      - log: "${body}"
----

If you want to create a sink kamelet, then you just name it with sink as follows (based on log sink):

[source,bash]
----
camel init wine-sink.kamelet.yaml
----

You can then change the route to use the wine kamelet as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "kamelet:cheese-source"
    parameters:
      period: "2000"
      message: "Hello World"
    steps:
      - to: "kamelet:wine-sink"
----

If you want to create a new Kamelet based on an existing Kamelet, for example, to create a new sink based on the existing MySQL:

[source,bash]
----
camel init orderdb-sink.kamelet.yaml --from-kamelet=mysql-sink
----

=== Run from clipboard

You can also run Camel routes directly from the OS clipboard. This allows copying some code,
and then quickly run this.

The syntax is

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.<extension>
----

Where `<extension>` is what kind of file the content of the clipboard is, such as `java`, `xml`, or `yaml` etc.

For example, you can copy this to your clipboard and then run it afterward:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="timer:foo"/>
  <log message="Hello World"/>
</route>
----

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.xml
----

==== Run and reload from clipboard

*Available since Camel 4.2*

It is also possible to run from clipboard in _reload_ mode as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.xml --dev
----

Then you can quickly make changes and copy to clipboard, and Camel JBang will update while running.

=== Sending messages via Camel

*Available since Camel 4*

When building integrations with Camel JBang, you may find yourself in need of being able
to send messages into Camel, to test your Camel routes. This can be challenging when the
Camel routes are connected to external systems using different protocols.

The best approach is to send messages into these external systems using standard tools provided
by these systems, which often can be done using CLI tools. However, in some situations, where you
may not be familiar with these tools, you can try to let Camel send the message. Note that this
can only be possible in some scenarios, and should only be used as a _quick way_.

Suppose you have a Camel route that consumes messages from an external MQTT broker:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: kamelet:mqtt5-source
      parameters:
        topic: temperature
        brokerUrl: tcp://mybroker:1883
      steps:
        - transform:
            expression:
              jq:
                expression: .value
        - log:
            message: The temperature is ${body}
----

In the example above the MQTT broker is running on hostname `mybroker` port 1883.

The idea with the `camel cmd send` command is to _tap into_ an existing running Camel integration,
and reuse an existing endpoint (if possible). In this example, we want to use the existing configuration
to avoid having to configure this again.

By executing the following from a shell

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd send --body=file:payload.json mqtt
----

We can send a message where the payload is loaded from a file (`_payload.json_`). You can also specify the payload in the CLI
argument, but it's cumbersome to specify JSON structure so often it's better to refer to a local file.

[source,json]
----
{
  "value": 21
}
----

The `mqtt` argument is the name of the existing running Camel integration. You can also specify the PID instead.
So what happens is that Camel will let the existing integration send the message.

Because the existing integration only has one route, then the `send` command will automatically pick
the `_from_` endpoint, i.e. `kamelet:mqtt5-source` with all its configuration. If there are multiple routes,
then you can filter which route/endpoint by the `--endpoint` option:

For example, to pick the first route by _route id_:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd send --body=file:payload.json --endpoint=route1 mqtt
----

Or to pick the first route that uses mqtt component:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd send --body=file:payload.json --endpoint=mqtt mqtt
----

We are fortunate in this situation as the endpoint can be used as both a _consumer_ and _producer_ in Camel,
and therefore we are able to send the message to the MQTT broker via `tcp://mybroker:1883` on topic _temperate_.

TIP: See more options with `camel cmd send --help`.

The source for this example is provided on GitHub at https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/mqtt)[camel-jbang MQTT example].

==== Poll messages via Camel

*Available since Camel 4.8*

The `camel cmd send` command has been improved to also _poll_ messages from Camel. This is needed
if you want to poll the latest messages from a Kafka topic, JMS queue, or download a file from FTP etc.

The poll uses Camel consumer to poll the message (timeout if no message received) instead of producer.

For example to poll a message from a ActiveMQ queue named cheese you can do:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd send --poll --endpoint='activemq:cheese'
----

When you poll then you do not send any payload (body or headers).

=== Receiving messages via Camel

*Available since Camel 4.9*

When building a prototype integration with Camel JBang, you may route messages to external systems.
To know whether messages are being routed correctly, you may use system consoles to look inside these systems
which messages have arrived, such as SQL prompts, web consoles, CLI tools etc.

The Camel JBang now comes with a new command to receive messages from remote endpoints.
This can be used to quickly look or tail in terminal the messages that an external systems has received.
Camel does this by consuming the messages (if the component has support for consumer) and then let Camel JBang dump the messages from the CLI.

For example to start dumping all messages from ActiveMQ in one command, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd receive --endpoint='activemq:cheese'
----

You can also use pattern syntax for the endpoint, so suppose you have the following route:

[source,java]
----
from("ftp:myserver:1234/foo")
  .to("log:order")
  .to("activemq:orders");
----

Then you can tell Camel to automatic start receiving messages with:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd receive --action=start
----

TIP: You can enable and disable this mode with `--action=start` and `--action-stop`.

Then Camel will automatically discover from the running integration, all the _producers_ and
find the first _producer_ that is remote and also has consumer support. In the example above,
that is the `activemq` component, and thus Camel will start receive from `activemq:orders`.

You can see the status via:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd receive
 PID   NAME   AGE   STATUS    TOTAL  SINCE  ENDPOINT
  4364  foo   1m33s  Enabled     18     2s  activemq://orders
----

You can then dump all the received messages with:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd receive --action=dump
----

This will dump all the messages, and continue to dump new incoming messages. Use (ctrl + c) to break and exit.
You can turn follow off with `--follow=false`.

TIP: Use `camel cmd receive --help` to see all the various options for this command.


=== Controlling local Camel integrations

To list the currently running Camel integrations, you use the `ps` command:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps
  PID   NAME                             READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica...   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude                             1/1   Running   4m34s
----

This lists the PID, the name and age of the integration.

You can use the `stop` command to stop any of these running Camel integrations.
For example, to stop dude, you can do

[source,bash]
----
camel stop dude
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

You can also stop by the PID:

[source,bash]
----
camel stop 62506
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

NOTE: You do not have to type the full name, as the stop command will match using integrations
that start with the input, for example, you can do `camel stop d` to stop all integrations
starting with d. If you have multiple integrations running with similar name such as `dude`, `dude2`, then
if you type `camel stop dude` then Camel will stop both integrations. However, if you want to only
stop a single integration then either stop via PID or use `camel stop dude!` with the `!` at the end.

To stop all integrations, then execute without any pid:

[source,bash]
----
camel stop
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 61818)
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

==== Watching local Camel integrations

Most of the management commands can run in _watch_ mode, which repetitively output the status in full-screen mode.
This is done using the `--watch` parameter as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps --watch
  PID   NAME                             READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica...   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude                             1/1   Running   4m34s
----

==== Controlling Spring Boot and Quarkus integrations

The Camel JBang CLI will by default only control Camel integrations that are running using the CLI, eg `camel run foo.java`.

For the CLI to be able to control and manage Spring Boot or Quarkus applications, then you need to add a dependency
to these projects to integrate with Camel CLI.

In Spring Boot, you add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-cli-connector-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In Quarkus, you need to add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-cli-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

==== Getting status of Camel integrations

The `get` command in Camel JBang is used for getting Camel specific status for one
or all of the running Camel integrations.

To display the status of the running Camel integrations:

[source,bash]
----
camel get
  PID   NAME      CAMEL   PLATFORM            READY  STATUS    AGE    TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  SINCE-LAST
 61818  MyCamel   3.20.0  Spring Boot v2.7.3   1/1   Running  28m34s    854       0         0     0s/0s/-
 63051  dude      3.20.0  JBang                1/1   Running     18s     14       0         0     0s/0s/-
 63068  mygroovy  3.20.0  JBang                1/1   Running      5s      2       0         0     0s/0s/-
----

The `camel get` command will default display Camel application (context), which is equivalent to
typing `camel get context`.

This displays overall information for every Camel integration, where you can see
the total number of messages processed. The column _Since Last_
shows how long time ago the last processed message for 3 stages (started/completed/failed).

The value of `0s/0s/-` means that the last started and completed message just happened (0 seconds ago),
and  that there has not been any failed message yet. And this example `9s/9s/1h3m` means that last started and
completed message is 9 seconds ago, and last failed were 1 hour and 3 minutes ago.

TIP: You can run in _watch_ mode using: `camel get --watch`

===== Total in Camel 4.7 and 4.8

From *Camel 4.7* onwards, two numbers will be displayed for _TOTAL_, _FAILED_, and _INFLIGHT_ columns.
The first number is messages received from external systems (databases, cloud systems), and the second
number is the total number (as in earlier versions).

[source,bash]
----
camel get
  PID   NAME    CAMEL  PLATFORM        PROFILE  READY  STATUS   RELOAD  AGE   ROUTE  MSG/S  TOTAL  FAIL  INFLIGHT  LAST  DELTA  SINCE-LAST
 42240  cheese  4.7.0  JBang v0.116.0  dev       1/1   Running       0  1m8s    2/2   1.01   1/65   0/0       0/0     0     -1     1s/1s/-
----

The _TOTAL_ column above shows `1/65` which mean that 1 message was from an external source, and 65 in total; which means that
64 are from internal sources (such as timer, seda).

===== Total in Camel 4.9 onwards

The TOTAL column is total number of messages processed. This is all messages both started internally (such as from a timer)
and received from external systems (databases, cloud systems). In *Camel 4.9* we made the TOTAL column a single digit again
to not confuse, and we added a new `REMOTE` column to show total for remote systems only. So the example above would be:

[source,bash]
----
camel get
  PID   NAME    CAMEL  PLATFORM        PROFILE  READY  STATUS   RELOAD  AGE   ROUTE  MSG/S  TOTAL  REMOTE  FAIL  INFLIGHT  LAST  DELTA  SINCE-LAST
 42240  cheese  4.9.0  JBang v0.118.0  dev       1/1   Running       0  1m8s    2/2   1.01     65       1   0/0       0/0     0     -1     1s/1s/-
----

==== Route status

You can also see the status of every route, from all the local Camel integrations with `camel get route`:

[source,bash]
----
camel get route
  PID   NAME      ID      FROM                        STATUS    AGE   TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST
 61818  MyCamel   hello   timer://hello?period=2000   Running  29m2s    870       0         0     0    0   14     0s/0s/-
 63051  dude      java    timer://java?period=1000    Running    46s     46       0         0     0    0    9     0s/0s/-
 63068  mygroovy  groovy  timer://groovy?period=1000  Running    34s     34       0         0     0    0    5     0s/0s/-
----

TIP: Use `camel get --help` to display all the available commands as additional will be added in upcoming releases.

==== Top status of Camel integrations

The `camel top` command is intended for getting top utilization statistics (highest to lowest heap used memory)
of the running Camel integrations.

[source,bash]
----
camel top
  PID   NAME     JAVA     CAMEL   PLATFORM            STATUS    AGE         HEAP        NON-HEAP     GC     THREADS   CLASSES
 22104  chuck    11.0.13  3.20.0  JBang               Running   2m10s  131/322/4294 MB  70/73 MB  17ms (6)      7/8  7456/7456
 14242  MyCamel  11.0.13  3.20.0  Spring Boot v2.7.3  Running  33m40s  115/332/4294 MB  62/66 MB  37ms (6)    16/16  8428/8428
 22116  bar      11.0.13  3.20.0  JBang               Running    2m7s   33/268/4294 MB  54/58 MB  20ms (4)      7/8  6104/6104
----

The _HEAP_ column shows the heap memory (used/committed/max) and the non-heap (used/committed).
The _GC_ column shows garbage collection information (time and total runs).
The _CLASSES_ column shows the number of classes (loaded/total).

You can also see the top performing routes (highest to lowest mean processing time)
of every route, from all the local Camel integrations with `camel top route`:

[source,bash]
----
camel top route
  PID   NAME     ID                     FROM                                 STATUS    AGE    TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST
 22104  chuck    chuck-norris-source-1  timer://chuck?period=10000           Started     10s      1       0         0   163  163  163          9s
 22116  bar      route1                 timer://yaml2?period=1000            Started      7s      7       0         0     1    0   11          0s
 22104  chuck    chuck                  kamelet://chuck-norris-source        Started     10s      1       0         0     0    0    0          9s

 14242  MyCamel  hello                  timer://hello?period=2000            Started  31m41s    948       0         0     0    0    4          0s
----

TIP: Use `camel top --help` to display all the available commands as additional will be added in upcoming releases.

==== Tailing logs

When you run Camel integrations, then they will by default run in the foreground and output logs.

NOTE: The `camel log` command is **not** supported when running in Spring Boot or Quarkus runtimes.

You can from another terminal access the logs from any Camel integration with the `log` command, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.288  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Apache Camel (JBang) 3.21.0 is starting
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.395  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Using Java 17.0.5 with PID 44619. Started by davsclaus in /Users/davsclaus/workspace/
...
----

You can also watch logs for all Camel integrations by `camel log`, or you can specify by name/pids (separate by comma) `camel log bar,chuck`.

It is also possible to find and highlight keywords from the log using `--find`, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --find=invoice
----

You can find multiple items by repeating the option, i.e.:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --find=invoice --find=order
----

There is also a _grep_ option that will filter the logs to only show lines that matches text (ignore case).

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --grep=error
----

The log command will by default tail the logs for new lines. If you want to exit the command immediately, you
can turn off the following as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --grep=error --follow=false
----

This will grep the logs for log lines with matches text `error` and output only these logs, and exit.

==== Tracing messages

The `trace` command is used for showing how messages are routed in Camel. The command has similar output as the `log`
command but only display message tracing information. This allows you to see every _step_ a message is routed in Camel.

The `trace` command has many options and can be used to _filter_, _grep_ or output on different detail _levels`.
The _exchange id_ is logged (and grouped by colour), so you can use that to correlate the events when traces are interleaved.

The trace command will by default list the status of whether tracing is enabled or not in the integrations:

[source,bash]
----
camel trace
 PID   NAME   AGE  STATUS   TOTAL  QUEUE  FILTER  PATTERN
 6911  chuck   5s  Standby      0      0
----

Here we can see that the tracer is in standby mode, and you need to start the tracer before Camel will capture messages:

TIP: Camel 4.8 onwards has tracing in standby mode (when using dev profile). You can enable tracing on startup by setting the configuration `camel.trace.enabled=true` in `application.properties`.

[source,bash]
----
camel trace --action=start
----

And if you run `camel trace` again you can see the tracer is started:

[source,bash]
----
camel trace
PID   NAME   AGE   STATUS   TOTAL  QUEUE  FILTER  PATTERN
6911  chuck  1m5s  Started     16      4
----

And to show the traces you need to use the `dump` action as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel trace chuck --action=dump
----

You can also dump traces from all running integrations:

[source,bash]
----
camel trace --action=dump
----

To stop tracing use `--action=stop`.

And you can also clear the already traced messages with `--action=clear`.

==== Running Camel integrations in background

The `run` command allows running Camel in the background with the `--background` option.
Therefore, to see and understand what happens then the management commands
cane be used, such as `camel ps`, `camel get`, and `camel log`.

NOTE: Only Camel Main is supported to run in background

[source,bash]
----
$ camel run chuck.yaml --background --runtime=main
Running Camel integration: chuck in background with PID: 80093

$ camel ps
  PID   NAME    READY  STATUS   AGE
 80093  chuck    1/1   Running  33s
----

To see the log use `camel log`
[source,bash]
----
$ camel log
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.288  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Apache Camel (JBang) 3.21.0 is starting
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.395  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Using Java 17.0.5 with PID 44619. Started by davsclaus in /Users/davsclaus/workspace/
...
----

To stop the integration you can use `camel stop`

[source,bash]
----
$ camel stop chuck
Shutting down Camel integration (pid: 80093)
----

When running in background, then Camel JBang (**4.10 onwards**) will now automatic wait for the integration
to startup before returning from the CLI command. This ensures that if there are any startup
errors such as compilation errors or DSL errors etc. then these are captured and printed in the shell.
You can use the option `--background-wait=false` to turn this off.

==== Starting and Stopping routes

The `camel cmd` is intended for executing miscellaneous commands in the running Camel integrations.
For example, there are commands to start and stop routes.

To stop all the routes in the chuck integration, you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stop-route chuck
----

And the status will then report the status as _Stopped_ for the chuck integration:

[source,bash]
----
camel get route
  PID   NAME     ID                     FROM                                 STATUS    AGE   TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST
 81663  chuck    chuck                  kamelet://chuck-norris-source        Stopped           600       0         0     0    0    1          4s
 81663  chuck    chuck-norris-source-1  timer://chuck?period=10000           Stopped           600       0         0    65   52  290          4s
 81663  chuck    log-sink-2             kamelet://source?routeId=log-sink-2  Stopped           600       0         0     0    0    1          4s
 83415  bar      route1                 timer://yaml2?period=1000            Started  5m30s    329       0         0     0    0   10          0s
 83695  MyCamel  hello                  timer://hello?period=2000            Started  3m52s    116       0         0     0    0    9          1s
----

To start the routes, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route chuck
----

To stop _all_ routes in every Camel integration:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stop-route
----

And you can start _all_ routes using:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route
----

To start a specific route, you need to use `--id` parameter such as the following,
which will start routes named `route1` in all running integrations:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route --id=route1
----

If you want to do this in a specific integration, you must include the name or pid:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route bar --id=route1
----

TIP: You can stop one or more route by their ids by separating using
comma such as `camel cmd start-route --id=route1,hello`.
Use `camel cmd start-route --help` for more details.

==== Running Camel integrations on Kubernetes

After developing the Camel routes locally with JBang, you may want to run these also on the Kubernetes platform at some point.

Camel JBang provides a plugin for managing and easily running Camel applications on Kubernetes.
The plugin uses the project export functionality to build and deploy the application on Kubernetes with Quarkus or SpringBoot.

Read about it in the xref:camel-jbang-kubernetes.adoc[Camel Kubernetes plugin] documentation.

==== Configuring logging levels

You can see the current logging levels of the running Camel integrations by:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd logger
  PID   NAME   AGE   LOGGER  LEVEL
 90857  bar   2m48s  root    INFO
 91103  foo     20s  root    INFO
----

The logging level can be changed at runtime, for example, to change foo to DEBUG you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd logger --logging-level=DEBUG foo
----

TIP: You can use `--all` to change logging levels for all running integrations.

===== Configuring individual logging levels

From *Camel 4.6* onwards you can easily configure different logging levels from CLI and `application.properties`.

For example from CLI, you can specify using the `--logging-category` option.
For example, to enable DEBUG logging if using Kafka:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel run myapp.yaml --logging-category=org.apache.kafka=DEBUG
----

You can specify multiple categories by repeating the CLI option as shown:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel run myapp.yaml --logging-category=org.apache.kafka=DEBUG --logging-category=com.foo.something=TRACE
----

You can also configure logging levels in `application.properties` using two styles

- `logging.level.` it is the default style used by Camel and Spring Boot
- `quarkus.log.category.` is used by Quarkus

For example, you can declare as follows:

[source,properties]
----

# make it easy to configure individual logging levels
logging.level.org.apache.kafka = DEBUG
logging.level.com.foo.something = TRACE

# you can also use quarkus style naming
quarkus.log.category."org.apache.kafka".level = DEBUG
quarkus.log.category."com.foo.something".level = TRACE
----

==== Listing services

Some Camel integrations may host a service which clients can call, such as REST, or SOAP-WS, or socket-level services using TCP protocols.

You can list the available services as shown in the example below:

[source,bash]
----
camel get service
 PID   NAME       COMPONENT      PROTOCOL  SERVICE
 1912  netty      netty          tcp       tcp:localhost:4444
 2023  greetings  platform-http  rest      http://0.0.0.0:7777/camel/greetings/{name} (GET)
 2023  greetings  platform-http  http      http://0.0.0.0:7777/q/dev
----

Here you can see 2 Camel integrations. The netty integration hosts a TCP service that is available on port 4444.
The other Camel integration hosts a REST service that can be called via GET only.
And finally the integration comes with embedded web console (started with the `--console` option).

NOTE: For a service to be listed then Camel components must be able to advertise the services using xref:camel-console.adoc[].

==== Observability with metrics

Camel JBang comes with support for using Micrometer for metrics that easily can be made available.

You simply either run with `--metrics` option, or enable and have more control of the configuration in the `application.properties` file as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
# enable HTTP server with metrics
camel.server.enabled=true
camel.server.metricsEnabled=true

# turn on micrometer metrics
camel.metrics.enabled=true
# include more camel details
camel.metrics.enableMessageHistory=true
# include additional out-of-the-box micrometer metrics for cpu, jvm and used file descriptors
camel.metrics.binders=processor,jvm-info,file-descriptor
----

Then you can access metrics from the web browser at: http://localhost:8080/q/metrics[http://localhost:8080/q/metrics]

You can also see metrics from the CLI as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel get metric
  PID   NAME         TYPE   METRIC                         ROUTE                  VALUE  MEAN  MAX  TOTAL
 11562  MyCoolCamel  timer  camel.exchange.event.notifier                             3    12   27     35
 11562  MyCoolCamel  timer  camel.exchange.event.notifier                             3     1    2      3
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  camel.routes.added                                        3
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  camel.routes.running                                      3
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  jvm.info                                                  1
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  process.cpu.usage                     0.0045185067010171795
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  process.files.max                                     10240
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  process.files.open                                      288
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  system.cpu.count                                          8
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  system.cpu.usage                        0.15222772277227722
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  system.load.average.1m                        3.58935546875
----

==== Listing state of Circuit Breakers

If your Camel integration uses xref:components:eips:circuitBreaker-eip.adoc[Circuit Breaker],
then you can output the status of the breakers with Camel JBang as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel get circuit-breaker
  PID   NAME  COMPONENT     ROUTE   ID               STATE      PENDING  SUCCESS  FAIL  REJECT
 56033  mycb  resilience4j  route1  circuitBreaker1  HALF_OPEN        5        2     3       0
----

Here we can see the circuit breaker is in _half-open_ state, i.e., a state where the breaker is attempting
to transition back to closed if the failures start to drop.

TIP: You can run the command with watch to keep showing the latest state `watch camel get circuit-breaker`.

=== Using Jolokia and Hawtio

The https://hawt.io/[Hawtio] web console allows inspecting running Camel integrations, such
as all the JMX management information, and not but least to visualize the Camel routes
with live performance metrics. Hawtio is a handy tool for many years, and we have made it
easy to use Hawtio with Camel JBang.

To let Hawtio able to inspect the Camel integrations, then the Jolokia JVM Agent
must be installed in the running integration, this can be done, either explicit as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps
  PID   NAME                             READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica...   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude.java                        1/1   Running   4m34s
----

With the PID you can then attach Jolokia:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia 62506
Started Jolokia for PID 62506
http://127.0.0.1:8778/jolokia/
----

Instead of using PID, you can also attach by name pattern.
In this example, because the
two Camel integrations have unique names (foo and dude), then you can also attach Jolokia
without knowing the PID as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia du
Started Jolokia for PID 62506
http://127.0.0.1:8778/jolokia/
----

Then you can launch https://hawt.io/[Hawtio] using Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel hawtio
----

This will automatically download and start Hawtio, and open in web browser.

TIP: See `camel hawtio --help` for options.

And when Hawtio launches in the web browser, click the _Discover_ tab which should
list all the local available Jolokia Agents (yes you can use `camel jolokia PID` to connect
to multiple different Camel integrations and from this list select which to load).

Click the green _lightning_ icon to connect to running Camel integration (of choice).

You can uninstall the Jolokia JVM Agent in a running Camel integration when no longer needed:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia 62506 --stop
Stopped Jolokia for PID 62506
----

It is also possible to do this with only one command, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel hawtio dude
----

Where _dude_ is the name of the running Camel integration. When you stop Hawtio (using `ctrl` + `c`)
then Camel will attempt to uninstall the Jolokia JVM Agent. However, this may not be
able to do this always, because the JVM is being terminated which can prevent camel-jbang
from doing JVM process communication to the running Camel integration.

=== Scripting from terminal using pipes

You can also execute a Camel JBang file as a script that can be used for terminal scripting with pipes and filters.

NOTE: Every time the script is executed, a JVM is started with Camel.
This is not very fast or low on memory usage,
so use Camel JBang terminal scripting where using Camel makes sense.
For example, to use
many Camel components or Kamelets, to more easily send or receive data from disparate IT systems.

This requires adding the following line in top of the file, for example, as in the `UpperCase.java` file below:

[source,text]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang --quiet camel@apache/camel script "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

//Will upper-case the input
public class UpperCase extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("stream:in")
                .setBody()
                .simple("${body.toUpperCase()}")
                .to("stream:out");
    }
}
----

To be able to execute this as a script, you need to set execute file permission:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x UpperCase.java
----

Then you can then execute this as a script:

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./UpperCase.java
----

Which should output:

[source,text]
----
HELLO
WORLD
----

Logging can be turned on using `--logging=true` which then logs to `.camel-jbang/camel-pipe.log` file.
The name of the logging file cannot be configured.

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./UpperCase.java --logging=true
----

==== Using stream:in with line vs. raw mode

When using `stream:in` to read data from _System in_ then the xref:components::stream-component.adoc[Stream component]
works in two modes:

- line mode (default): reads input as single lines (separated by line breaks).
  Message body is a `String`.
- raw mode: reads the entire stream until the _end of stream_.
  Message body is a `byte[]`.

IMPORTANT: The default mode is due to historically how the stream component was created.
Therefore, you may want to set `stream:in?readLine=false` to use raw mode.

=== Running local Kamelets

You can also use Camel JBang to try local Kamelets, without the need to publish them on GitHub or package them in a jar.

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=/path/to/local/kamelets earthquake.yaml
----

TIP: When the kamelets are from local file system, then they can be live reloaded if they are updated, when you run
Camel JBang in `--dev` mode.

You can also point to a folder in a GitHub repository. For example, we have provided some custom Kamelets
at https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets, which can be used easily:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets user.java
----

NOTE: If a kamelet is loaded from GitHub, then they cannot be live reloaded.

=== Using the platform-http component

NOTE: Camel JBang is only intended for working with `platform-http` as HTTP server component for rest-dsl,
and for HTTP serer in general. It is not intended to work with `camel-servlet` or `camel-jetty`. If you find a need for using Jetty,
then Camel JBang will not support seamless rest-dsl support and exporting.

When a route is started from `platform-http` then Camel JBang will automatically include a VertX HTTP server
running on port 8080. For example, the following route in a file named `server.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "platform-http:/hello"
    steps:
      - set-body:
          constant: "Hello World"
----

Can be run with

[source,bash]
----
camel run server.yaml
----

And you can call the HTTP service with:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello World%
----

=== Using Java beans and processors

There is basic support for including regular Java source files together with Camel routes,
and let Camel JBang runtime compile the Java source. This means you can include smaller utility
classes, POJOs, Camel Processors and whatnot that the application needs.

=== Dependency Injection in Java classes

When running Camel integrations with camel-jbang, then the runtime is `camel-main` based. This means
there is no Spring Boot or Quarkus available.
However, we have added support for using annotation-based dependency injection in Java classes.

==== Using Camel dependency injection

You can use the following Camel annotations on Camel standalone:

- `@org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry` on class level (for custom beans, processors, etc.) to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@org.apache.camel.Configuration` on class level for `CamelConfiguation` classes, which is used during Camel startup (only Camel Main runtime) to allow custom setup that requires some coding.

And these annotations should work on all runtimes
(if target runtime is either Quarkus or Spring Boot then favour using their annotations):

- `@org.apache.camel.BeanInject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field.
- `@org.apache.camel.PropertyInject` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.
- `@org.apache.camel.Converter` on class level to auto-register the xref:type-converter.adoc[type converters] from the class.

IMPORTANT: You can use `@BeanInject` annotation to refer to existing bean annotated with `@BindToRegistry`, however, this is possible if the dependency is registered before the dependant.

==== Using Spring Boot dependency injection

You can use the following Spring Boot annotations:

- `@org.springframework.stereotype.Component` or `@org.springframework.stereotype.Service` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.

==== Using Quarkus injection

You can use the following Quarkus annotations:

- `@javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` or `@javax.inject.Singleton` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@javax.inject.Inject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.

==== Using beans in Camel XML DSL

Since Camel *4.0.0*, when using xref:components:others:java-xml-io-dsl.adoc[XML DSL],
we can declare additional beans in a similar way as in xref:components:others:yaml-dsl.adoc[YAML DSL].
Such beans will be added to the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] and can be referred to, for example, from routes.

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

	<bean name="beanFromMap" type="com.acme.MyBean">
		<properties>
			<property key="foo" value="bar" />
		</properties>
	</bean>

</camel>
----

The properties of the bean can be defined using either nested `<property>` and `<properties>` elements or using dotted properties style, as shown in the example below:

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <!-- nested properties style -->
	<bean name="beanFromMap" type="com.acme.MyBean">
		<properties>
			<property key="field1" value="f1_p" />
			<property key="field2" value="f2_p" />
			<property key="nested">
				<properties>
					<property key="field1" value="nf1_p" />
					<property key="field2" value="nf2_p" />
				</properties>
			</property>
		</properties>
	</bean>

    <!-- dotted properties style -->
	<bean name="beanFromProps" type="com.acme.MyBean">
		<properties>
			<property key="field1" value="f1_p" />
			<property key="field2" value="f2_p" />
			<property key="nested.field1" value="nf1_p" />
			<property key="nested.field2" value="nf2_p" />
		</properties>
	</bean>

</camel>
----

==== Using Spring beans in Camel XML DSL

Since Camel *4.0.0*, when using xref:components:others:java-xml-io-dsl.adoc[XML DSL], we can also declare _beans_ using Spring Beans XML namespace.
All these beans will be added to the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].

This will not make the application managed by Spring Framework / Spring Boot. Simply Camel will leverage existing support for generic bean definition including:

* dependency injection
* constructor injection
* dependency cycles
* wiring existing Camel objects (like `org.apache.camel.CamelContext`)

xref:components:others:java-xml-io-dsl.adoc[XML DSL] allows using XML documents that define routes, rests and route templates. Since Camel *4.0.0* these documents may use a new root XML element (either `<camel>` or `<beans>` to resemble Spring XML DSL), where other Camel elements (like `<routes>`) are contained.

Here's an example `camel.xml` file, which defines both the routes and beans used (referred to) by the route definition:

.camel.xml
[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
        <bean id="messageString" class="java.lang.String">
            <constructor-arg index="0" value="Hello"/>
        </bean>

        <bean id="greeter" class="org.apache.camel.main.app.Greeter">
            <description>Spring Bean</description>
            <property name="message">
                <bean class="org.apache.camel.main.app.GreeterMessage">
                    <property name="msg" ref="messageString"/>
                </bean>
            </property>
        </bean>
    </beans>

    <route id="my-route">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <bean ref="greeter"/>
        <to uri="mock:finish"/>
    </route>

</camel>
----

This document contains embedded `<beans>` element using Spring Beans XML namespace (`http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans`) - Camel passes this element directly to Spring `org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanDefinitionReader` and all read beans are used to populate xref:registry.adoc[Camel Registry].

The beans declared this way may use references to some predefined Camel beans.
Currently, these are handled:

* `_CamelContext_`: an instance of current `org.apache.camel.CamelContext`
* `_MainConfiguration_`: an instance of `org.apache.camel.main.MainConfigurationProperties` used for `org.apache.camel.main.KameletMain`

So we can use this XML fragment without actually defining what `CamelContext` is.

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
        <bean id="greeter" class="org.apache.camel.main.app.Greeter">
            <property name="camelContext" ref="CamelContext"/>
            <!-- ... -->
        </bean>
    </beans>

    <route id="my-route">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <bean ref="greeter"/>
        <to uri="mock:finish"/>
    </route>

</camel>
----

What's more, we can declare some additional beans that can affect internal mechanics of `CamelContext` being run. `org.apache.camel.main.DefaultConfigurationConfigurer` is used by xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main] to configure `CamelContext` using beans found in xref:registry.adoc[Camel Registry].

For example, we can customize used `org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator` with this XML fragment to replace UUID generator used by Camel (which defaults to `org.apache.camel.support.DefaultUuidGenerator`):

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
        <bean id="customUUIDGenerator" class="org.apache.camel.support.ShortUuidGenerator" />
    </beans>

</camel>
----

That's it - Camel context will then look up for the instances of `org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator` and if one is found, it'll be used by Camel.

=== Configuring JDBC DataSources

When using SQL databases, then you would often need to configure a JDBC connection pool. You can do this:

- Manually by adding 3rd party JAR dependency for the data source (and connection pool), and configure this from Java or XML/YAML DSL.
- *Camel 4.6* Spring Boot style with `spring.datasource.` configuration in `application.properties` (uses Hikari connection-pool)

==== Defining datasource in YAML DSL as a bean

Here is a snippet how you can declare a bean as the `DataSource` for a Postgres database in YAML DSL:

[source,yaml]
----
- beans:
    - name: PostgresqlDataSource
      properties:
        databaseName: "postgres"
        password: "postgres"
        portNumber: "5432"
        serverName: localhost
        user: postgres
      type: org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource
----

You would then also need to add the JAR dependency with Maven coordinates: `org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.3`.

==== Using a Spring Boot JDBC data source

In `application.properties` you can set up the datasource such as:

[source,properties]
----
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:sqlserver://db.example.net:1433;databaseName=test_db
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
----

The name of the `DataSource` will be registered with `springDataSource`, however you can configure the name via:

[source,properties]
----
spring.datasource.name=myDataSourceNameHere
----

TIP: Some JDBC drivers are automatic detected by camel-jbang.
If not, then you need to add the JAR dependency manually.

And you can configure the Hikari connection-pool (if needed), such as:

[source,properties]
----
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=600000
spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=1800000
spring.datasource.hikari.pool-name=collection-pool
----

And you can set logging to DEBUG on hikari to see the actual configuration:

[source,properties]
----
logging.level.com.zaxxer.hikari = DEBUG
----

=== Debugging

There are two kinds of debugging:

* _Java debugging_: Java code debugging (Standard Java)
* _Camel route debugging_: Debugging Camel routes (requires Camel tooling plugins)

==== Java debugging

Camel JBang makes it easy to do _Java debugging_ when you run your integration with the `--jvm-debug` option as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.yaml --jvm-debug
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

As you can see the default listening port is 4004 but can be configured as described in https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/debugging.html[JBang Debugging].

This is a standard Java debug socket. You can then use the IDE of your choice. For instance, see the generic documentation for https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/attaching-to-local-process.html#create-rc[IntelliJ], https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging#_attach[VS Code] and https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html#remote-debugging[Eclipse Desktop]. You will surely want to add `Processor` to be able to put breakpoints hit during route execution (as opposed to route definition creation).

===== Standard JBang debugging

You can debug your integration scripts by making use of the `--debug` flag provided by JBang.

[source,bash]
----
jbang --debug  camel@apache/camel run hello.yaml
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

This makes it possible to debug any of the Camel JBang commands, not only the `run` command as shown above.

==== Camel route debugging

With *Camel 4.2* onwards you can now easily debug Camel routes from the command shell with the `debug` command as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml
----

This will run the integration (in background), and the current shell running in foreground will act as a CLI based debugger.
You can see snippets from the log (in the top), the middle section shown the current breakpoint.
And in the bottom you can see content of the message (similar to the `camel trace` command)

[source,text]

    Breakpoint suspended. Press ENTER to continue.
----

This is _basic_ but yet powerful, as you have this debugger always readily available, without having to start up VSCode or IDEA tooling.

TIP: The `camel debug` can debug almost all the DSLs (there is a problem with groovy).

===== Configuring breakpoints

When using `camel debug` then breakpoints are by default added to every route.
However, you can specify which breakpoints to use instead with the `--breakpoint` option.
This parameter is able to match the Camel routes using a pattern style:

1. Exact match by node ids
2. Match node ids by pattern (wildcard and regular expression)
3. Match by EIP kind (setHeader, setBody, choice, split, etc.)
4. Match by source and line number
5. Match by line number

Multiple breakpoints can be separated by comma.

For example, to set a breakpoint at the setHeader EIP, you do:

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml --breakpoint=setHeader
----

To set a breakpoint at line 18:

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml --breakpoint=18
----

To set a breakpoint at line 18 and 34

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml --breakpoint=18,34
----

==== Editing code using VSCode or IDEA editors

You can use JBang to edit the source code by using the `jbang` CLI to download dependencies,
and set up a project for being ready to load into an IDE of choice, such as IDEA, VSCode, or Eclipse.

This is typically in use when you use Java DSL and have Camel routes in .java source code.
To let JBang understand which dependencies are in use, then you need to use JBang style for specifying
dependencies by using `//DEPS` code comments in Java code.

Given the following source file in `foo.java` file:

[source,java]
----
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-bom:4.3.0@pom
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-endpointdsl
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-netty-http
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-stream

// add more dependencies here

import org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.EndpointRouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpMessage;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class foo extends EndpointRouteBuilder {

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(foo.class);

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from(timer("trigger").period(5000).repeatCount(3))
                .to(nettyHttp("https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/banks").keepAlive(true))
                .process(e -> {
                    // use classes from camel-netty-http dependency in the source code
                    // and have jbang able to generate project with the dependencies ready
                    // to use in your IDE of choice
                    NettyHttpMessage msg = e.getMessage(NettyHttpMessage.class);
                    LOG.info("Netty HTTP response:\n\n\n{}\n\n\n", msg.getHttpResponse());
                })
                .log("Found bank:")
          .to(stream("out"));
    }
}
----

TIP: You can use `camel dependency update foo.java` to update the dependencies.

Notice how we specify https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/dependencies.html[JBang dependencies] at the top of the file.
We want JBang to know and prepare for the IDE of choice.
The first `//DEPS` is the `@pom` which set up the Camel version to use.
The following `//DEPS` declares the Camel component we use.

You can now open this source file for editing in your IDE of choice by using jbang CLI as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang edit -b foo.java
----

You can find this example at: https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/jbang-edit

==== Updating dependencies in source code

When working with Java source code, then you can keep the JBang dependencies up to date using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel dependency update foo.java
----

TIP: You can use `--clean` to not keep any existing dependencies and generate a clean fresh list.

This will then automatic insert or update the JBang dependencies (`//DEPS`) in the top of the source file.

You may want to use this for making it easier to load the source into an IDE editor to do coding.
See the previous section for more details.

===== Updating dependencies in Maven projects

Camel JBang can also help with keeping Camel Maven dependencies up-to-date for Maven based projects.

For example if start using new Camel components, in your Camel routes. Then you would have to
add the corresponding Camel JAR dependencies to the pom.xml file.

You can use the `camel dependency update` command to automate this, by executing from the project folder:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel dependency update pom.xml
----

Notice, that only adding new Camel dependencies is supported. If you remove a component,
then you need to remove the dependency from the pom.xml manually.
Also, this is only intended for production code from `src/main` folder.

==== Camel route debugging using VSCode or IDEA editors

The Camel route debugger is available by default (the `camel-debug` component is automatically added to the classpath). By default, it can be reached through JMX at the URL `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/camel`.

You can then use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. For instance, https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9371-apache-camel[IntelliJ], https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel[VS Code] or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textual-debugging-apache-camel[Eclipse Desktop].

A specific how-to is available for VS Code, see this https://youtu.be/owNhWxf42qk[video].

TIP: When exporting to Maven projects, then you can use the maven profile `camel.debug` that will include the `camel-debug` JAR
to make it possible for Camel IDE tools to do Camel route debugging.

==== Health Checks

The status of health checks can be accessed via Camel JBang from the CLI as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health
  PID   NAME    AGE  ID             RL  STATE  RATE    SINCE   MESSAGE
 61005  mybind   8s  camel/context   R   UP    2/2/-  1s/3s/-
----

Here we can see the Camel is _UP_. The application has just been running for 8 seconds, and there
 have been two health checks invoked.

The output is showing the _default_ level of checks as:

- `CamelContext` health check
- Component-specific health checks (such as from `camel-kafka` or `camel-aws`, ...)
- Custom health checks
- Any check that are not UP

The _RATE_ column shows 3 numbers separated by `/`. So `2/2/-` means two checks in total, two successes, and no failures.
The two last columns will reset when a health check changes state as this number is the number of consecutive
checks that was successful or failure. So if the health check starts to fail, then the numbers could be:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health
  PID   NAME     AGE   ID             RL  STATE   RATE    SINCE    MESSAGE
 61005  mybind   3m2s  camel/context   R   UP    77/-/3  1s/-/17s  some kind of error
----

Here we can see the numbers are changed to `77/-/3`. This means the total is 77. There is no success, but
the check has been failing three times in a row. The _SINCE_ column corresponds to the _RATE_. So in this
 case, we can see the last check was 1 second ago, and that the check has been failing for 17 seconds in a row.

You can use `--level=full` to output every health check, that will include consumer and route level checks
as well.

A health check may often be failed due to an exception was thrown which can be shown via `--trace` flag:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health --trace

Here we can easily see that the health check is failing because of the `org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigException`
which is due to invalid configuration: `Invalid url in bootstrap.servers: value`.

TIP: Use `camel get health --help` to see all the various options.


== Running with Spring Boot or Quarkus

Camel JBang is __primary__ intended to be Camel standalone only. In *Camel 4.6* onwards, we added limited
support for running with Spring Boot or Quarkus, but there are some limitations.

You use the `--runtime` option to specify which platform to use, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=spring-boot
----

And for Quarkus:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=quarkus
----

When running this way, then Camel JBang is _essentially_ doing an _export_ to a temporary folder,
and then running Spring Boot or Quarkus using Maven.

You can do changes to the source file and have Quarkus and Spring Boot reload the routes, just as `camel run --dev` can do,
but uses the natural Spring Boot _dev-tools_ and Quarkus _dev mode_ functionality.

There are several limitations, one would be that Spring Boot and Quarkus cannot automatically detect new components and download JARs.
(you can stop and run again to update dependencies).

When using Quarkus, then you can only select the Quarkus version to run. That is locked to a specific Camel version.
You can see the versions by `camel version list --runtime=quarkus`. On the other hand Spring Boot is more flexible
where you can choose different Spring Boot and Camel versions (within reasonable range).

For example:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=spring-boot --spring-boot-version=3.2.3 --camel-version=4.4.1
----

And for Quarkus:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=quarkus --quarkus-version=3.9.4
----


== Transforming message (data mapping)

When integrating a system, you often need to transform messages from one system to another. Camel has a rich set
of capabilities for this such as various data formats, templating languages, and much more. However, for basic
data mapping such as taking an existing incoming JSON document and transforming this to a smaller JSON document,
you may want to do this quickly with Camel.

The `camel transform message` command can be used for such tasks, where it can take an existing source file as input,
and then a template that defines how to transform the data, and then show the output (in real time).

For example, given this JSon document (in a file named `random.json`), we want to combine the name, and select a few fields:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 9914,
  "uid": "eb5fa603-1db6-45f9-912a-431a6ed59b18",
  "password": "ei7gvYKdnN",
  "first_name": "Khalilah",
  "last_name": "Monahan",
  "username": "khalilah.monahan",
  "email": "khalilah.monahan@email.com",
  "avatar": "https://robohash.org/utnumquamexcepturi.png?size=300x300&set=set1",
  "gender": "Agender",
  "phone_number": "+54 (421) 591-5640 x333",
  "social_insurance_number": "268418308",
  "date_of_birth": "1975-03-11",
  "employment": {
    "title": "Product Design Director",
    "key_skill": "Work under pressure"
  },
  "address": {
    "city": "New Fritzchester",
    "street_name": "Patrick Common",
    "street_address": "4538 Reggie Inlet",
    "zip_code": "16282-7045",
    "state": "New York",
    "country": "United States",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": -1.9868753435474673,
      "lng": 39.09763956726292
    }
  },
  "credit_card": {
    "cc_number": "4493983042212"
  },
  "subscription": {
    "plan": "Student",
    "status": "Active",
    "payment_method": "Debit card",
    "term": "Monthly"
  }
}
----

Then we can have a `transform.json` file as the beginning of the template, with the structure of the desired output:

[source,json]
----
{
    "sid": 123,
	"name": "TODO",
	"country": "TODO",
	"phone": "TODO",
	"student": false
}
----

We can then run `camel transform message` and have it update (in real time) the output every time we change the template.

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:random.json --language=simple --template=file:transform.json --pretty --watch
----

What happens is then Camel will output on the console as you go:

[source,bash]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   23F5DD4CE6C260B-0000000000000002
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 118)
 {
   "sid": 123,
   "name": "TODO",
   "country": "TODO",
   "phone": "TODO",
   "student": false
 }
----

Then you can update the `transform.json` file and save it and see the generated output:

[source,json]
----
{
   "sid": ${jq(.id)},
   "name": "${jq(.first_name)} ${jq(.last_name)}",
   "country": "TODO",
   "phone": "TODO",
   "student": false
}
----

And the output:

[source,bash]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   23F5DD4CE6C260B-0000000000000018
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 158)
 {
   "sid": 9914,
   "name": "Khalilah Monahan",
   "country": "TODO",
   "phone": "TODO",
   "student": false
 }
----

Then you can continue to update the `transform.json` until you have the desired result.
And if you make a mistake, then you see an error (in red) with stacktrace that hopefully can help you out how to fix this.

=== Transforming directly from the Camel DSL source

In the example above we externalize the transformation into a template file named `transform.json`.
However, it's possible to transform directly in the Camel DSL route.

NOTE: Currently Java DSL is not working in --watch mode (reload on change)

In the following, we cover the json-transform example from: https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/json-transform

In this example, a random beer is fetched via the beer-source kamelet. The beer data is as follows:

[source,json]
----
 {
   "id": 2104,
   "uid": "cefb36e1-e42f-4083-8f97-fc4ff85e56fb",
   "brand": "Pabst Blue Ribbon",
   "name": "St. Bernardus Abt 12",
   "style": "Belgian Strong Ale",
   "hop": "Amarillo",
   "yeast": "1388 - Belgian Strong Ale",
   "malts": "Caramel",
   "ibu": "43 IBU",
   "alcohol": "3.8%",
   "blg": "16.0°Blg"
 }
----

We save this beer into a file named `sample.json` as we want to use this as source for message transformation.

Now suppose we want to transform this to a smaller JSON document with only a few elements, then we can do this
directly in the route:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    nodePrefixId: route-c38
    id: route-66b0
    from:
      uri: kamelet:beer-source
      id: from-3996
      steps:
        - setBody:
            expression:
              simple:
                expression: >-
                  TODO
                id: simple-b320
            id: setBody-fa01
        - log:
            message: ${body}
            id: log-0c79
----

As we can see the route has a `setBody` where we want to transform the message, which we can do with the simple
language combined with JQ (or JSonPath). At first, we just write TODO to get started:

[source,bash]
----
camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --source=beer-jq.yaml  --watch --pretty
----

And the output from the transformation is:

[source,text]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   D9F909701338607-0000000000000004
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 4)
 TODO
----

We can now do live updates in the Camel route, and when we save the file, the transform command will output the changes in the terminal.
So we modify the DSL to grab the details we want, such as:

[source,yaml]
----
    expression: >-
      {
        "kind": "${jq(.brand)}",
        "beer": "${jq(.name)}"
      }
    id: simple-b320
----

Notice how we use inlined JQ expressions to grab the desired data from the sample, and when saving the file, we have
the result shown in the terminal:

[source,text]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   D9F909701338607-000000000000003E
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 78)
 {
   "kind": "Pabst Blue Ribbon",
   "beer": "St. Bernardus Abt 12"
 }
----

And when we are done with the transformation we can stop by `ctrl + c` to exit the command.

When transforming messages directly from the DSL (using the `--source` option), then by default
Camel will pick the last expression in the route. If you only have one expression like in this example,
then that is easy. But when you have many, then you need to tell which one to use.

You can do this either by referring to the line number in the source code of the EIP / expression, or
by its id (if specified).

So suppose the example had many expressions, and the one we want to use is on line 11, then we can do as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --source=beer-jq.yaml:11  --watch --pretty
----

Notice how we specify the line number in the source file name, by prefixing with `:line-number`.
The line number does not have to be 100% accurate, as long the number is within range of the EIP, until
the next EIP in the route. In the example, this means you can pick number in range 8-17.

If we want to use the id of the expression/EIP, we can do the same as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --source=beer-jq.yaml:setBody-fa01  --watch --pretty
----

You can also transform the message from JSON to XML as shown (or any other kind of fixed structure):

[source,yaml]
----
- setBody:
    expression:
      simple:
        expression: >-
          <beer id="${jq(.id)}">
            <name>${jq(.name)}</name>
            <kind>${jq(.brand)}</kind>
          </beer>
        id: simple-b320
    id: setBody-fa01
----

You can configure options that the language format should use, such as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --language=jsonpath --template="beer.unknown" --option=suppressExceptions=true
----

TIP: You can specify multiple options by repeating the `--option` argument.

Pay attention that we now use JSONPath as the language, and the template is a tiny JSON path expression.
Because the sample does not have a `beer.unknown` path, then JSonPath would normally throw an exception.
This can be suppressed by setting the option `suppressExceptions` to `true` as shown above. Then the output is as follows:

[source,text]
----
2023-12-04 13:02:50.923  66291 --- Message transformed (success) (239ms)
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   6118686CA3995FF-0000000000000000
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (null) (bytes: 14)
 [Body is null]
----

=== Transforming the message using Components

Some components can also be used for message transformation such as FlatPack, Velocity, FreeMarker, Thymeleaf, and good old XSLT.

TIP: You can use `camel catalog component --filter=transform` to see which components can be transformation.

Given the below XML in the `sample.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<hash>
  <id type="integer">1369</id>
  <uid>8c946e1a-fdc5-40d3-9098-44271bdfad65</uid>
  <account-number>8673088731</account-number>
  <iban>GB38EFUA27474531363797</iban>
  <bank-name>ABN AMRO MEZZANINE (UK) LIMITED</bank-name>
  <routing-number>053228004</routing-number>
  <swift-bic>AACCGB21</swift-bic>
</hash>
----

Then you can transform this using an XSLT named `mystyle.xsl`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version = "1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <bank>
    	<name><xsl:value-of select="/hash/bank-name/text()"/></name>
    	<bic><xsl:value-of select="/hash/swift-bic/text()"/></bic>
    </bank>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
----

Then you can do live changes to the stylesheet and see the output in real-time with Camel JBang by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:sample.xml --component=xslt --template=file:mystyle.xsl --pretty --watch
----

You can then edit the `mystyle.xsl` file, and save the file, and watch the terminal for the updated result.

You can find this example at: https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/xslt-transform

You can configure options that the XSLT component format should use, such as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:sample.xml --component=xslt --template=file:mystyle.xsl --option=output=bytes --pretty --watch
----

TIP: You can specify multiple options by repeating the `--option` argument.

NOTE: The transform message with the component is limited as some components require configuring complex options that cannot be set from command line.

=== Transforming a message using Data Formats

Some data formats can also be used for message transformation such as Base64, Csv, FlatPack.

TIP: You can use `camel catalog dataformat --filter=transform` to see which components can be transformation.

Given the below CSV file in the `daltons.csv`:

[source,text]
----
Jack Dalton, 115, mad at Averell
Joe Dalton, 105, calming Joe
William Dalton, 105, keeping Joe from killing Averell
Averell Dalton, 80, playing with Rantanplan
Lucky Luke, 120, capturing the Daltons
----

Then you can transform this via Camel CSV dataformat from its form into Java objects (unmarshal).
This will NOT transform the CSV into another format such as XML, but allows you to quickly try out the dataformat,
and be able to inspect the Java object inside Camel.

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:daltons.csv --dataformat=csv
----

This will then output:

[source,text]
----
2023-12-04 10:53:45.578  55793 --- Message transformed (success) (176ms)
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   6673987D34F3B54-0000000000000000
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (ArrayList) (size: 5 bytes: 224)
 [[Jack Dalton,  115,  mad at Averell], [Joe Dalton,  105,  calming Joe], [William Dalton,  105,  keeping Joe from killing Averell], [Averell Dalton,  80,
 playing with Rantanplan], [Lucky Luke,  120,  capturing the Daltons]]
----

As you can see Camel CSV dataformat will then unmarshal the input (from CSV file) to a `java.util.ArrayList` object
with 5 elements (one per row), and each row is another List of the columns.

You can configure options that the CSV data format should use, such as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:daltons.csv --dataformat=csv --option=captureHeaderRecord=true
----

TIP: You can specify multiple options by repeating the `--option` argument.

NOTE: The transform message with dataformat is limited as some dataformat requires configuring complex options that cannot be set from the command line.

== Transforming routes DSL

Camel offers different DSLs, such as Java, XML, YAML, and more. Many graphical editors and code generators use XML and YAML Camel DSL, therefore, for some use cases it may be required to use one DSL or the other.
The `camel transform route` command can be used to transform a YAML route into an XML and vice versa, the command takes a list of files as input and transforms the DSL.

For example, given the following YAML content, in a file named route.yaml

[source:yaml]
----
- route:
    id: route-b785
    nodePrefixId: route-14b
    from:
      id: from-959e
      uri: direct
      parameters:
        name: start
      steps:
        - choice:
            id: choice-52fe
            when:
              - id: when-b126
                expression:
                  simple:
                    id: simple-576d
                    expression: ${header.foo} == 'bar'
                steps:
                  - to:
                      id: to-65f9
                      uri: jms
                      parameters:
                        destinationName: queue
            otherwise:
              id: otherwise-c07f
              steps:
                - to:
                    id: to-dc76
                    uri: log
                    parameters:
                      loggerName: default
----

The following command

[source:bash]
----
camel transform route --format=xml /path/to/route.yaml
----

Automatically transform the route in XML DSL (Camel XML IO DSL)

[source:xml]
----
<camel>
    <route id="route-b785" nodePrefixId="route-14b">
        <from id="from-959e" uri="direct:start"/>
        <choice id="choice-52fe">
            <when id="when-b126">
                <simple>${header.foo} == 'bar'</simple>
                <to id="to-65f9" uri="jms:queue"/>
            </when>
            <otherwise id="otherwise-c07f">
                <to id="to-dc76" uri="log:default"/>
            </otherwise>
        </choice>
    </route>
</camel>
----

TIP: If all the input files have the same extension and are written with the same DSL, for example, `.yaml`, the transformation will default to the XML DSL and vice versa.

== Listing what Camel components are available

Camel comes with a lot of artifacts out of the box which comes as:

- components
- data formats
- expression languages
- miscellaneous components
- kamelets

You can use the Camel CLI to list what Camel provides via the `camel catalog` command.
For example, to list all the components

[source,bash]
----
camel catalog component
----

And to see which Kamelets are available:

[source,bash]
----
camel catalog kamelet
----

TIP: Use `camel catalog --help` to see all possible commands.

=== Displaying component documentation

The `doc` goal can show quick documentation for every component, dataformat, kamelets etc.
For example, to see the kafka component you run:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka
----

NOTE: The documentation is not the full documentation as shown on the website, as the Camel CLI does not have direct
access to this information and can only show a basic description of the component, but include tables for every
configuration option.

To see the documentation for jackson dataformat:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc jackson
----

In some rare cases then there may be a component and dataformat with the same name, and the `doc` goal prioritizes
components. In such a situation you can prefix the name with dataformat, i.e.:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc dataformat:thrift
----

You can also see the kamelet documentation such as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc aws-kinesis-sink
----

==== Browsing online documentation from the Camel website

You can use the `doc` command to quickly open the url in the web browser for the online documentation.
For example, to browse the kafka component, you use `--open-url`:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --open-url
----

This also works for data formats, languages, kamelets etc.

[source,bash]
----
camel doc aws-kinesis-sink --open-url
----

TIP: To just get the link to the online documentation, then use `camel doc kafka --url`.

==== Filtering options listed in the tables

Some components may have many options, and in such cases you may use `--filter` to only list options that match the filter
in either name, description, or the group (producer, security, advanced, etc).

For example, to list only security related options:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --filter=security
----

And to list only something about _timeout_:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --filter=timeout
----

== Open API

Camel JBang allows quickly exposing an Open API service using _contract-first_ approach,
where you have an existing OpenAPI specification file.

Then Camel JBang is able to bridge each API endpoint from the OpenAPI specification to
a Camel route with the naming convention `direct:<operationId>`.

This make it quick to implement a Camel route for a given operation.

See the https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/open-api[open-api example] for more details.

== Gathering list of dependencies

When working with Camel JBang, then dependencies are automatically resolved. This means that
you do not have to use a build system like Maven or Gradle to add every Camel component
as a dependency.

However, you may want to know what dependencies are required to run the Camel integration.
To see this, you can use the `dependency` command. The command output does not output a detailed
tree, such as `mvn dependencies:tree`, as the output is intended to list which Camel components,
and other JARs needed (when using Kamelets).

The dependency output by default is _vanilla_ Apache Camel with the camel-main as runtime, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency list
org.apache.camel:camel-dsl-modeline:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-health:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-kamelet:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-log:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-rest:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-stream:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-timer:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-yaml-dsl:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets:0.9.3
----

The output is by default a line per maven dependency in GAV format (_groupId:artifactId:version_).

You can also specify the output should be in _Maven format_ as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency list --output=maven
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-main</artifactId>
    <version>3.20.0</version>

    <groupId>org.apache.camel.kamelets</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-kamelets</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.3</version>
</dependency>
----

You can also choose the target runtime as either _quarkus_ or _spring-boot_ as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency --runtime=spring-boot
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator:2.7.5
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:2.7.5
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-spring-boot-engine-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-dsl-modeline-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-kamelet-starter:3.20.0

org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-timer-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-yaml-dsl-starter:3.20
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets:0.9.3
----

== Generating SBOM report

[source,bash]

You can generate a SBOM report of your integration by running the following command

----
camel sbom
----

By default, it will generate a file named `sbom.json` in `cyclonedx` format.

You can also choose to use an `spdx` format with the following command

----
camel sbom --sbom-format=spdx
----

You can also choose the target runtime as either _quarkus_ or _spring-boot_ as shown:

----
camel sbom --runtime=quarkus
----

or

----
camel sbom --runtime=spring-boot
----

by default `camel-main` will be used

=== Copying dependency JARs to a specific directory

You can use the `camel dependency copy` command to copy the required JARs to a specific folder.

IMPORTANT: The `camel dependency copy` and `camel dependency list` uses Apache Maven,
This requires having Apache Maven installed, and `mvn` command in PATH environment, so Camel JBang
can invoke `mvn` command.

By default, the JARs are copied to `lib` folder:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency copy
ls lib
camel-api-3.21.0.jar                    camel-health-3.21.0.jar                 camel-yaml-dsl-3.21.0.jar
camel-base-3.21.0.jar                   camel-main-3.21.0.jar                   camel-yaml-dsl-common-3.21.0.jar
camel-base-engine-3.21.0.jar            camel-management-api-3.21.0.jar         camel-yaml-dsl-deserializers-3.21.0.jar
camel-core-engine-3.21.0.jar            camel-rest-3.21.0.jar                   jakarta.activation-api-1.2.2.jar
camel-core-languages-3.21.0.jar         camel-support-3.21.0.jar                jakarta.xml.bind-api-2.3.3.jar
camel-core-model-3.21.0.jar             camel-timer-3.21.0.jar                  slf4j-api-1.7.36.jar
camel-core-processor-3.21.0.jar         camel-tooling-model-3.21.0.jar          snakeyaml-engine-2.3.jar
camel-core-reifier-3.21.0.jar           camel-util-3.21.0.jar
camel-dsl-support-3.21.0.jar            camel-util-json-3.21.0.jar
----

== Creating Projects

You can _export_ your Camel JBang integration to a traditional Java-based project such as Spring Boot or Quarkus.

You may want to do this after you have built a prototype using Camel JBang, and are in need
of a traditional Java-based project with more need for Java coding, or wanting to use the powerful
runtimes of Spring Boot, Quarkus or vanilla Camel Main.

=== Exporting to Camel Spring Boot

The command `export --runtime=spring-boot` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven-based
Spring Boot project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example, to export to Spring Boot using the Maven groupId `_com.foo_` and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directory (copies the files), you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

When exporting to Spring Boot then the Camel version defined in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` is
the same version as Camel JBang uses. However, you can specify the Camel version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject --camel-spring-boot-version=3.18.3
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

=== Exporting to Camel Quarkus

The command `export --runtime=quarkus` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven-based
Quarkus project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example, to export to Quarkus using the Maven groupId `_com.foo_` and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the necessary folder structure.

To export to another directory (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

NOTE: You cannot use `--profile` option when exporting to Camel Quarkus.

=== Exporting to Camel Main

The command `export --runtime=camel-main` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven-based
vanilla Camel Main project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example, to export to Camel Main using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directory (copies the files), you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

==== Exporting with Java Agent included

The Camel Main runtime allows exporting with Java Agents that makes it easier to run your Camel integration
with Java Agents such as OpenTelemetry Agent.

NOTE: Only `camel-main` as runtime supports exporting with Java Agents included.

This requires specifying the agent as a dependency with `agent:` as prefix as shown below in `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
camel.jbang.dependencies=camel:opentelemetry,agent:io.opentelemetry.javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent:1.31.0
camel.opentelemetry.enabled=true
----

Then you can export to `--runtime=camel-main` as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

Then Camel JBang will detect the `agent:` dependency and download this from Maven and save to a `../myproject/agent` folder.
You can then start the Camel integration from Java via:

[source,bash]
----
cd ../myproject
mvn clean package
java -javaagent:agent/opentelemetry-javaagent-1.31.0.jar -jar target/acme-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

=== Exporting with selected files

By default, Camel will export what was last run, or all files from the current directory.
You can also explicitly specify which files should be exported.

For example, you may have 3 files in a folder:

- Foo.java
- bar.xml
- cheese.yaml

These are 3 Camel routes, and you want to export them into 2 different applications:

[source,bash]
----
camel export Foo.java --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../export1
camel export bar.xml cheese.yaml --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:cheese:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../export2
----

As you can see the first export command will only include `Foo.java`, and then 2nd export includes both `bar.xml` and `cheese.yaml`.

NOTE: If you have `application.properties` in the folder as well, then this will be included in both exports.

=== Exporting as Gradle Project

Camel JBang exports by default as a Maven-based project. To use Gradle instead, you can
specify the `--build-tool=gradle` when exporting, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --build-tool=gradle --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

=== Exporting with JMX management included

Usually when exporting to Spring Boot, Quarkus or Camel Main, then JMX management is not included out of the box.
To include JMX, you need to add `camel:management` in the `--dep` option, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --dep=camel:management --directory=../myproject
----

=== Exporting with Camel CLI included

Usually when exporting to Spring Boot, Quarkus or Camel Main, then Camel JBang CLI is not included out of the box.
To be able to continue to use Camel CLI (i.e. `camel`), you need to add `camel:cli-connector` in the `--dep` option, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --dep=camel:cli-connector --directory=../myproject
----

=== Troubleshooting exporting

When exporting then Camel CLI performs a set of tasks which can go wrong.
To see more activity during exporting you can turn on both `--verbose` and `--logging` that
prints more information to the console. You can also set `--logging-level=DEBUG` to output even more details.

If your Camel application cannot be exported, for example due to some custom Java code, you can
try to export with `--ignore-loading-error`.

TIP: Camel will by default store export logs to `<user home>/.camel/camel-export.log` file of the last export run (unless you turn on `--logging` that logs only to console).

=== Configuring exporting

The export command will by default load configuration from `application.properties`
which also can be used to specific parameters for export such as selecting the runtime and java version.

The follow options related to _exporting_, can be configured in `application.properties`:

|===

|===

NOTE: These are options from the export command, so you can see more details and default values using `camel export --help`.

== Configuration

Camel JBang `config` command is used to store and use the user configuration. This eliminates the need to specify CLI options each time. For example, to run a different Camel version, instead of executing

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --camel-version=3.18.4
----

the camel-version can be added to the user configuration such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel config set camel-version=3.18.4
----

Now, the run command picks the user configuration:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

=== Configuration Locations

Camel JBang uses two possible configuration files:

- Global configuration: ~/.camel-jbang-user.properties
- Local configuration: ./camel-jbang-user.properties

=== Configuration Precedence

When both files exist, the local configuration takes precedence over the global configuration.

=== Using Configuration Commands

All camel config commands target the global configuration by default. To work with the local configuration instead, add the `--global=false` flag:
[source,bash]
----
camel config <command> --global=false
----
This directs all configuration changes to the local ./camel-jbang-user.properties file.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use both a set version via `camel config set` and also a version specified via `--camel-version` option,
i.e., the following is not possible:

[source,bash]
----
camel config set camel-version=4.0.1
camel run * --camel-version=4.3.0
----

=== Set and unset configuration

Every Camel JBang option is added to the user configuration. For example, to export a simple project such as

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.yaml
camel config set gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
camel config set runtime=spring-boot
camel config set deps=org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-timer-starter
camel config set camel-spring-boot-version=3.20.1

camel export
----

User configuration keys are unset using the following:

[source,bash]
----
camel config unset camel-spring-boot-version
----

=== List and get configurations

User configuration keys are listed using the following:

[source,bash]
----
camel config list
----

Following is the output for the above-mentioned configuration.

[source,bash]
----
runtime = spring-boot
deps = org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-timer-starter
gav = com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

To obtain a value for the given key, use the `get` command.

[source,bash]
----
camel config get gav

com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

=== Placeholders' substitutes

User configuration values can be used as placeholder substitutes with command line properties, for example:

[source,bash]
----
camel config set repos=https://maven.repository.my.repo.com/ga

camel run 'Test.java' --logging-level=info --repos=#repos,https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

In this example, since `repos` is set in the user configuration (`config set`) and the `camel run` command declares the placeholder `#repos`, `camel run` will replace the placeholder so that both repositories will be used during the execution.
Notice, that to refer to the configuration value the syntax is `#optionName` eg `#repos`.

NOTE: The placeholder substitution only works for every option that a given Camel command has.
You can see all the options a command has via the help, eg `camel run --help`.


== Troubleshooting

When using https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] then JBang stores state in `~/.jbang` directory.
This is also the location where JBang stores downloaded JARs.

Camel JBang also downloads needed dependencies while running. However, these dependencies
are downloaded to your local Maven repository `~/.m2`.

So if you find problems with running Camel JBang using what is seems like an outdated JAR, then you can
try to delete these directories or parts of it.

== Infrastructure

Camel JBang `infra` command can be used to `list`, `run` and `stop` external services that can be used for fast prototyping and testing.
Apache Camel test-infra Services are exposed via the `infra` command, in this way, the same infrastructure that is used to test
Apache Camel itself, is exposed via Camel JBang, and services that are already proved to work with Apache Camel can be easily used.

=== List Services

Supported external services can be listed with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
camel infra list
----

Following is the output for the above-mentioned configuration.

[source,bash]
----
ALIAS                   IMPLEMENTATION
 ignite
 azure                   storage-queue
 openldap
 event-bridge
 xmpp
 kinesis
 redis
 ...
----

=== Run Service

Supported external services can be run with the following command (Docker or Podman is required for most of the service):

[source,bash]
----
camel infra run $SERVICE ($OPTIONAL_SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION)
----

Once the service is up and running, information about the service are printed as json that can be easily used in the Camel Routes,
for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra run ftp

Starting service ftp
{
  "getPort" : 52472,
  "getFtpRootDir" : "file://path/to/current/directory/target/ftp/camel-test-infra-test-directory/camel-test-infra-configuration-test-directory"
}
----

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra run kafka redpanda

Starting service kafka with implementation redpanda
{
  "getBootstrapServers" : "localhost:32771"
}
----

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra run openldap

Starting service openldap
{
  "getPort" : 32774,
  "getSslPort" : 32775,
  "getHost" : "localhost"
}
----

=== Stop Service

Stop a running infrastructure service:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra run arangodb
...

$ camel infra ps
 ALIAS             IMPLEMENTATION  DESCRIPTION
 arangodb                          ArangoDB is a multi-model database for high-performance applications.

$ camel infra stop arangodb
Shutting down service arangodb (PID: {pidNumber})
----

=== List running services

Display running services, useful to retrieve the service ALIAS

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra run arangodb
...

$ camel infra ps
 ALIAS             IMPLEMENTATION  DESCRIPTION
 arangodb                          ArangoDB is a multi-model database for high-performance applications.
---

=== Get running service

Display running service information, the command will print the json containing information about the running service (ex. host, port, username)

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra run openldap
...

$ camel infra get openldap
{
  "getPort" : 32774,
  "getSslPort" : 32775,
  "getHost" : "localhost"
}
---

=== Get running services logs

The command `camel infra log` gathers and displays the log of all running services (similar to tail command)

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra log
[service1] ...
[service2] ...
[service1] ...
[service2] ...
[service2] ...
[service2] ...
[service1] ...
[service2] ...
[service1] ...
[service1] ...
[service1] ...
---

In order to retrieve the log of a specific service the service alias can be provided

[source,bash]
----
$ camel infra log service
[service] ...
[service] ...
[service] ...
---

== Update

Apache Camel applications can be automatically updated using Camel JBang. The update command provides two main operations:

- `list`: Shows available Apache Camel versions for updating
- `run`: Executes the actual update process 

The update process leverages the https://github.com/apache/camel-upgrade-recipes[Apache Camel Open Rewrite recipes] and supports three application types:

- Plain Camel (camel-main)
- Camel Quarkus
- Camel Spring Boot

While Camel and Camel Spring Boot updates primarily use camel-upgrade-recipes, 
Camel Quarkus updates involve both the Quarkus runtime (via https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-quarkus[Rewrite Quarkus]) and Apache Camel recipes.

=== Listing Available Updates

To see which versions are available for updating, use:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel update list

 VERSION                       RUNTIME            RUNTIME VERSION  DESCRIPTION                                                                    
 4.4.4                         Camel Quarkus      3.8.x            Migrates `camel 4.0` quarkus application to `camel 4.4`.                       
 4.8.0                         Camel                               Migrates Apache Camel 4 application to Apache Camel 4.8.0                      
 4.8.3                         Camel Quarkus      3.15.x           Migrates `camel 4.4` quarkus application to `camel 4.8`.                       
 4.9.0                         Camel                               Migrates Apache Camel 4 application to Apache Camel 4.9.0                      
 4.9.0                         Camel Spring Boot  3.4.0            Migrates Apache Camel Spring Boot 4 application to Apache Camel Spring Boot 4.9.0
----

=== Running Updates

To perform an update to a specific version:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel update run $VERSION
----

NOTE: The update commands must be executed in the project directory containing the pom.xml file.

==== Configuration Options

The update process can be customized with several options:

----= Camel Maven Archetypes

Camel is distributed with the following archetypes for Maven end users.

== Archetype Supported

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Archetype |Description

|camel-archetype-api-component |This archetype is used for creating a new
Maven project for Camel xref:components::index.adoc[Components]. Use this if
there is an API component missing in Camel that you want to create yourself.

|camel-archetype-component |This archetype is used for creating a new
Maven project for Camel xref:components::index.adoc[Components]. Use this if
there is a component missing in Camel that you want to create yourself.

|camel-archetype-cdi |This archetype is used to create a
new Maven project for Camel routes in the Java Container using CDI to
configure components, endpoints and beans.

|camel-archetype-dataformat |This archetype is used for
creating a new Maven project for Camel xref:data-format.adoc[Data
Format]s. Use this if there is a data format missing in Camel that you
want to create yourself.

|camel-archetype-java |This archetype is used to create a new Maven
project for Camel routes using Java DSL.

|camel-archetype-main |This archetype is used to create a new Maven
project for Camel routes running Camel standalone (camel-main).

|camel-archetype-spring |This archetype is used to
create a new Maven project for XML DSL routes using Spring.

|camel-archetype-spring-boot |This archetype is used to
create a new Maven project for Camel routes using Spring Boot.

|camel-archetype-endpointdsl |This archetype is used to
create a new Maven project for Camel routes using Endpoint DSL.

|=======================================================================

The maven coordinates for these archetypes is the following:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.archetypes</groupId>
  <artifactId>${archetype-name}</artifactId>
  <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Snapshot Archetypes

If you would like to use an archetype from an unreleased version of
Camel, you just need to let the maven-archetype-plugin know where to
look for it. For example, say someone wanted to create a Java based
project based on Camel 3.21.0-SNAPSHOT. He'd need to use the following command

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-java \
  -DarchetypeVersion=3.21.0-SNAPSHOT
----

When the project is created, you may need to add another repository to
the pom.xml file. This is to load a SNAPSHOT version of the
camel-maven-plugin

[source,xml]
----
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots/>
    <id>Apache Snapshot Repository</id>
    <url>http://repository.apache.org/snapshots</url>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
----

= Camel Maven Plugin

The Camel Maven Plugin supports the following goals

 - camel:run - To run your Camel application
 - camel:dev - To run your Camel application in developer mode
 - camel:debug - To run your Camel application in debug mode
 - camel:prepare-fatjar - To prepare your Camel application for being packaged as a fat-jar (such as by maven-assembly-plugin)

== camel:run

The `camel:run` goal of the Camel Maven Plugin is used to run your Camel Spring configurations in a forked JVM from Maven.
A good example application to get you started is the Spring Example.

----
cd examples/camel-example-spring
mvn camel:run
----

This makes it very easy to spin up and test your routing rules without having to write a main(...) method;
it also lets you create multiple jars to host different sets of routing rules and easily test them independently.

How this works is that the plugin will compile the source code in the maven project,
then boot up a Spring ApplicationContext using the XML configuration files on the classpath at `META-INF/spring/*.xml`

If you want to boot up your Camel routes a little faster, you could try the `camel:embedded` instead.

=== Options

The maven plugin *run* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| duration | -1 | Sets the time duration (seconds) that the application will run for before terminating. A value <= 0 will run forever.
| durationIdle | -1 | Sets the idle time duration (seconds) duration that the application can be idle before terminating. A value <= 0 will run forever.
| durationMaxMessages | -1 | Sets the duration of maximum number of messages that the application will process before terminating.
| logClasspath | false | Whether to log the classpath when starting
| loggingLevel | OFF | Whether to use built-in console logging (uses log4j), which does not require to add any logging dependency to your project. However, the logging is fixed to log to the console, with a color style that is similar to Spring Boot. You can change the root logging level to: FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, OFF
| profile |  | To run with a specific Camel Main profile (dev,test,prod)
|===



=== Logging the classpath

You can configure whether the classpath should be logged when `camel:run` executes.
You can enable this in the configuration using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <logClasspath>true</logClasspath>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

=== Using built-in logging

If you want quickly to have logging to console, you can use the built-in logging by setting the logging level as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <loggingLevel>INFO</loggingLevel>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

This runs the application with console logging, in color that is similar to Spring Boot logging.
This is default turned off, to use the configured logging system in the project.

The idea with the built-in logging is that you sometimes want to avoid messing with setting
up logging, and just want a quick and easy log to console that looks good.


== camel:dev

The `camel:dev` is an extension to `camel:run` to run the Camel application in developer mode.
In this mode, among others, Camel will use hot-reloading of DSL routes (xml, yaml and java) that are located from
the `src/main/resources` directory.

=== Options

The maven plugin *dev* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| routesDirectory | src/main/resources | To watch the directory for file changes which triggers a live reload of the Camel routes on-the-fly.
| duration | -1 | Sets the time duration (seconds) that the application will run for before terminating. A value <= 0 will run forever.
| durationIdle | -1 | Sets the idle time duration (seconds) duration that the application can be idle before terminating. A value <= 0 will run forever.
| durationMaxMessages | -1 | Sets the duration of maximum number of messages that the application will process before terminating.
| logClasspath | false | Whether to log the classpath when starting
| loggingLevel | OFF | Whether to use built-in console logging (uses log4j), which does not require to add any logging dependency to your project. However, the logging is fixed to log to the console, with a color style that is similar to Spring Boot. You can change the root logging level to: FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, OFF
| profile | dev | To run with a specific Camel Main profile (dev,test,prod)
|===

== camel:debug

The `camel:debug` is an extension to `camel:dev` to run the Camel application in debug mode which allows to debug the Camel routes thanks to the Camel textual route debugger.

=== Options

The maven plugin *debug* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| suspend | true | Indicates whether the message processing done by Camel should be suspended as long as a debugger is not attached.
|===

== camel:prepare-fatjar

The `camel:prepare-fatjar` goal of the Camel Maven Plugin is used to prepare your Camel application
for being packaged as a _fat jar_. The goal scans the Maven dependencies to discover Camel JARs and
extract if they have type converters, which gets merged together into a single _uber_ file stored
in `target/classes/META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/UberTypeConverterLoader`.

This _uber_ loader file contains all the combined type converters the Camel application uses at runtime.
They are merged together into this single file.

This is needed as otherwise the _fat jar_ maven plugins (such as maven-assembly-plugin, or maven-shade-plugin)
causes the `TypeConverterLoader` files to be overwritten in the assembled JAR which causes not all type converters
to be loaded by Camel.

The `UberTypeConverterLoader` ensures they all type converters gets loaded as this file contains all the known
type converter files.

To use this goal, you can add the following to your Camel application `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>

For example to use this with the `maven-assembly-plugin` you can do as below.
Remember to specify the class name of *your* main class where it says `com.foo.NameOfMainClass`:

= Camel Report Maven Plugin

The Camel Report Maven Plugin supports the following goals

 - camel-report:validate - To validate your source code for invalid Camel endpoint uris
 - camel-report:route-coverage - To report the coverage of your Camel routes after unit testing

== camel-report:validate

For validating the source code for mis-configured Camel:

- endpoint uris
- simple expressions or predicates
- duplicate route ids
- seda/direct endpoint pairs
- configuration in properties files

Then you can run the `validate` goal from the command line or from within your Java editor such as IDEA or Eclipse.

----
mvn camel-report:validate
----

You can also enable the plugin to run automatically as part of the build to catch these errors.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-report-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>validate</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

The phase determines when the plugin runs. In the sample above the phase is `process-classes` which runs after
the compilation of the main source code.

The maven plugin can also be configured to validate the test source code , which means that the phase should be
changed accordingly to `process-test-classes` as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-report-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <configuration>
        <includeTest>true</includeTest>
      </configuration>
      <phase>process-test-classes</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>validate</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

=== Running the goal on any Maven project

You can also run the validate goal on any Maven project without having to add the plugin to the `pom.xml` file.
Doing so requires to specify the plugin using its fully qualified name. For example to run the goal on
the `camel-example-cdi` from Apache Camel you can run

----
$cd camel-example-cdi
$mvn org.apache.camel:camel-report-maven-plugin:2.20.0:validate
----

which then runs and outputs the following:

----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Building Camel :: Example :: CDI 3.0.0
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO]
[INFO] --- camel-report-maven-plugin:3.0.0:validate (default-cli) @ camel-example-cdi ---
[INFO] Endpoint validation success: (4 = passed, 0 = invalid, 0 = incapable, 0 = unknown components)
[INFO] Simple validation success: (0 = passed, 0 = invalid)
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

The validation passed, and 4 endpoints was validated. Now suppose we made a typo in one of the Camel endpoint uris in the source code, such as:

[source,java]
----
@Uri("timer:foo?period=5000")
----


is changed to include a typo error in the `period` option

[source,java]
----
@Uri("timer:foo?perid=5000")
----

And when running the `validate` goal again reports the following:

----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Building Camel :: Example :: CDI 3.0.0
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO]
[INFO] --- camel-report-maven-plugin:3.0.0:validate (default-cli) @ camel-example-cdi ---
[WARNING] Endpoint validation error at: org.apache.camel.example.cdi.MyRoutes(MyRoutes.java:32)

	timer:foo?perid=5000

	                   perid    Unknown option. Did you mean: [period]


[WARNING] Endpoint validation error: (3 = passed, 1 = invalid, 0 = incapable, 0 = unknown components)
[INFO] Simple validation success: (0 = passed, 0 = invalid)
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

=== Options

The maven plugin *validate* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| downloadVersion | true | Whether to allow downloading Camel catalog version from the internet. This is needed if the project uses a different Camel version than this plugin is using by default.
| failOnError | false | Whether to fail if invalid Camel endpoints was found. By default the plugin logs the errors at WARN level.
| coverageThreshold | 100 | The minimum route coverage in percent when using failOnError.
| overallCoverageThreshold | 0 | The minimum coverage across all routes in percent when using failOnError.
| logUnparseable | false | Whether to log endpoint URIs which was un-parsable and therefore not possible to validate.
| includeJava | true | Whether to include Java files to be validated for invalid Camel endpoints.
| includeXml | true | Whether to include XML files to be validated for invalid Camel endpoints.
| includeTest | false | Whether to include test source code.
| includes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to only include files matching any of the given list of patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| excludes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to exclude files matching any of the given list of patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| ignoreUnknownComponent | true | Whether to ignore unknown components.
| ignoreIncapable | true | Whether to ignore incapable of parsing the endpoint uri or simple expression.
| ignoreLenientProperties | true | Whether to ignore components that uses lenient properties. When this is true, then the uri validation is stricter but would fail on properties that are not part of the component but in the uri because of using lenient properties. For example using the HTTP components to provide query parameters in the endpoint uri.
| ignoreDeprecated | true |Whether to ignore deprecated options being used in the endpoint uri.
| duplicateRouteId | true |Whether to validate for duplicate route ids. Route ids should be unique and if there are duplicates then Camel will fail to startup.
| directOrSedaPairCheck | true |Whether to validate direct/seda endpoints sending to non existing consumers.
| configurationFiles | application.properties | Location of configuration files to validate. The default is application.properties. Multiple values can be separated by comma and use wildcard pattern matching.
| showAll | false | Whether to show all endpoints and simple expressions (both invalid and valid).
| downloadTransitiveArtifacts | false | When sourcesArtifacts are declared, this flag can be used to download transitive dependencies, carefully enable this flag since it will try to download the whole dependency tree.
| sourcesArtifacts | | List of sources transitive dependencies that contain camel routes, this option can be used to download extra dependencies that contain camel route that your project may depend on.
| extraMavenRepositories | | List of extra maven repositories.
|===

For example to turn on ignoring usage of deprecated options from the command line, you can run:

----
$mvn camel-report:validate -Dcamel.ignoreDeprecated=true
----

Notice that you must prefix the `-D` command argument with `camel.`, eg `camel.ignoreDeprecated` as the option name.

=== Validating include test

If you have a Maven project then you can run the plugin to validate the endpoints in the unit test source code as well.
You can pass in the options using `-D` style as shown:

----
$cd myproject
$mvn org.apache.camel:camel-report-maven-plugin:3.0.0:validate -Dcamel.includeTest=true
----

=== Validate Apache Camel routes in transitive dependencies

If your routes use `direct` or `seda` endpoints that are not present in the current project, but the routes are declared into a dependency of your project, you can edit the plugin configuration accordingly so that these routes can be taken into account by the Camel validate plugin.
In particular, in order to use the validate plugin with transitive dependencies, *sources jars are needed*, for example:

* Given the following Camel route `from("direct:in").to("direct:out")` defined in the current project
* The route `from("direct:out")` is declared into a dependency of your project, for example `my.company:routes-dependency:1.0`
* If `routes-dependency` sources are released into a maven repository, the following plugin configuration can be used:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-report-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>validate</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <sourcesArtifacts>
          <sourcesArtifact>my.company:routes-dependency:jar:sources:1.0</sourcesArtifact>
        </sourcesArtifacts>
        <extraMavenRepositories>
          <extraMavenRepository>http://internal.repo:8080/maven</extraMavenRepository>
        </extraMavenRepositories>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

== camel-report:route-coverage

For generating a report of the coverage of your Camel routes from unit testing.
In the same manner you can generate Java code coverage reports, then this is the same but for Camel routes.
You can therefore use this to know which parts of your Camel routes have been used or not.

Camel uses JMX to capture metrics during tests which are used for calculating route coverage.
You must have `camel-management` JAR on the classpath (can be test scoped)
such as by declaring the following Maven dependency in your pom.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- JMX is needed for route coverage testing -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-management</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Enabling route coverage

You can enable route coverage while running unit tests either by:

- setting global JVM system property enabling for all test classes
- using `@EnableRouteCoverage` annotation per test class if using `camel-test-spring-junit5` module
- overriding `isDumpRouteCoverage` method per test class if using `camel-test` module

==== Enabling via JVM system property

You can turn on the JVM system property `CamelTestRouteCoverage` to enable route coverage for all tests cases.
This can be done either in the configuration of the `maven-surefire-plugin`:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <systemPropertyVariables>
      <CamelTestRouteCoverage>true</CamelTestRouteCoverage>
    </systemPropertyVariables>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Or from the command line when running tests:

----
mvn clean test -DCamelTestRouteCoverage=true
----

==== Enabling via @EnableRouteCoverage annotation

You need to enable route coverage in the unit tests classes. You can do this by adding the `@EnableRouteCoverage`
annotation to the test class if you are testing using `camel-test-spring-junit5`:

[source,java]
----
@CamelSpringBootTest
@SpringBootTest(classes = SampleCamelApplication.class)
@EnableRouteCoverage
public class FooApplicationTest {
----

==== Enabling via isDumpRouteCoverage method

However if you are using `camel-test` and your unit tests are extending `CamelTestSupport` then you can
turn on route coverage as shown:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public boolean isDumpRouteCoverage() {
    return true;
}
----

IMPORTANT: Routes that can be route coveraged **MUST** have a unique id assigned, in other words you cannot use anonymous routes.

You do this using `routeId` in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:cheese").routeId("cheesy")
  .to("log:foo")
  ...
----

And in XML DSL you just assign the route id via the id attribute

[source,xml]
----
<route id="cheesy">
  <from uri="jms:queue:cheese"/>
  <to uri="log:foo"/>
  ...
</route>
----

=== Generating route coverage report

After unit testing with:

----
mvn test
----

You can then run the goal to report the route coverage

----
mvn camel-report:route-coverage
----

Which then reports which routes has missing route coverage with precise source code line reporting:

----
[INFO] --- camel-camel-report-plugin:3.0.0:route-coverage (default-cli) @ camel-example-spring-boot-xml ---
[INFO] Discovered 1 routes
[INFO] Route coverage summary:

File:	src/main/resources/my-camel.xml
RouteId:	hello

  Line #      Count   Route
  ------      -----   -----
      28          1   from
      29          1     transform
      32          1     filter
      34          0       to
      36          1     to

Coverage: 4 out of 5 (80.0%)
----

Here we can see that the 2nd last line with `to` has `0` in the count column, and therefore is not covered.
We can also see that this is one line 34 in the source code file, which is in the `my-camel.xml` XML file.

=== Options

The maven plugin *coverage* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax),
 or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| failOnError | false | Whether to fail if any of the routes has not 100% coverage.
| includeTest | false | Whether to include test source code.
| includes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to only include files matching any of the given list of
 patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| excludes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to exclude files matching any of the given list of
 patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| anonymousRoutes | false | **Deprecated** Whether to allow anonymous routes (routes without any route id assigned).
 By using route id's then it is safer to match the route cover data with the route source code.
 Anonymous routes are less safe to use for route coverage as its harder to know exactly which route
 that was tested corresponds to which of the routes from the source code.
| generateJacocoXmlReport | false | Whether to generate a coverage-report in Jacoco XML format. When enabled it will generate the file: `target/site/jacoco/xmlJacoco.xml`
| generateHtmlReport | false | Whether to generate a coverage-report in HTML format. When enabled it will generate the file: `target/site/route-coverage/html/index.html`
|===

= CamelContext Auto Configuration

The xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] is autoconfigured when running Camel with either
xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main], Camel Spring Boot, Camel Quarkus.

== Camel Autoconfiguration

Under these runtimes then the autoconfiguration is performed by shared code from the `camel-main` JAR
to ensure the configuration is similar on these runtimes.

The autoconfiguration is executed in several steps:

1. Configure `CamelContext` (and more such as components) from xref:components::properties-component.adoc[properties] from external sources like `application.properties|yaml`
2. Configure optional services that have been registered in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]

=== Autoconfiguration of Properties

This is used for configuring the standard set of more than 100 options which are listed in the _Camel Main Options_ table at xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main].

NOTE: When using Camel on Spring Boot, then these options are prefixed with `camel.springboot`, and not `camel.main`.

=== Autoconfiguration of Optional Services

After configuring the standard options, then Camel will look in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] for custom
services to be used.
For example, to plug in a custom `UnitOfWorkFactory`.

The services can be anything that can be plugged into Camel (typically services that implement an SPI interface `org.apache.camel.spi`).

The following SPI services can only a single instance (singleton) be in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].

[width="100%",cols="2m,8",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|SPI |Description
| AsyncProcessorAwaitManager | To use a custom async processor await manager
| BacklogTracer | To use a custom backlog tracer
| ClassResolver | To use a custom class resolver. This is only necessary if you run Camel on a special application server to deal with classloading.
| Debugger | To use a custom xref:debugger.adoc[debugger]
| EventFactory | To use a custom event notifier factory

= CamelContext

The https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/latest/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html[`CamelContext`] is the runtime system, which holds together all the fundamental concepts of Apache Camel (routes, endpoints, components, etc).

This context object represents the Camel runtime system. Typically, you have one `CamelContext` instance in an application.

image::images/camel-context.png[image]

The `CamelContext` provides access to many features and services, the most notable being components, type converters, a registry, endpoints, routes, data formats, and languages.

The following table lists the most common services provided by the `CamelContext`:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]

== CamelContext 101

To give you a better understanding of Apache Camel, we'll discuss what is inside the `CamelContext`.

=== Routing Engine

Camel's routing engine moves messages under the hood and does all the heavy lifting to ensure that messages are routed properly. It is not exposed to the developer, but you should be aware that it's there.

=== Routes

xref:routes.adoc[Routes] are a core abstraction for Camel. The simplest way to define a route is as a chain of xref:processor.adoc[Processors]. There are many reasons for using routers in messaging applications.
By decoupling clients from servers, and producers from consumers, routes can, for example, do the following:

* Decide dynamically what server a client will invoke
* Provide a flexible way to add extra processing
* Allow independent development for clients and servers
* Foster better design practices by connecting disparate systems that do one thing well
* Allow for clients of servers to be stubbed out (using xref:components::mock-component.adoc[mocks]) for testing purposes

Each route in Camel has a unique identifier. You can use the identifier to log, debug, monitor, and start and stop routes.

Routes have one and only one input source for messages. They are effectively tied to an input endpoint.

=== Domain Specific Language (DSL)

To wire processors and endpoints together to form routes, Camel defines a xref:dsl.adoc[DSL].

In Camel with Java, DSL means a fluent Java API that contains methods named for EIP terms.

Consider this example:

[source,java]
----
from("file:data/inbox")
    .filter().xpath("/order[not(@test)]")
        .to("jms:queue:order");
----

Here, in a single Java statement, you define a route that consumes files from a xref:components::file-component.adoc[file] endpoint.
Camel uses the xref:components:eips:filter-eip.adoc[Filter EIP] to route the messages using an XPath predicate to test whether the message is not a test order. If a message passes the test, Camel forwards it to the xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] endpoint. Messages failing the filter test are skipped.

Camel provides multiple DSL languages. You could define the same route using the XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="file:data/inbox"/>
    <filter>
        <xpath>/order[not(@test)]</xpath>
        <to uri="jms:queue:order"/>
    </filter>
</route>
----

And in YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "file:data/inbox"
    steps:
      - filter:
          xpath: "/order[not(@test)]"
          steps:
            - to: "jms:queue:order"
----

The DSLs provide a nice abstraction for Camel users to build applications. Under the hood, though, a route is composed of a graph of processors.

=== Processors

The xref:processor.adoc[processor] is a core Camel concept that represents a node capable of using, creating,
or modifying an incoming xref:exchange.adoc[exchange].

During routing, exchanges flow from one processor to another; as such, you can think of a route as a graph having specialized processors
as the nodes, and lines that connect the output of one processor to the input of another.
Processors could be implementations of EIPs, producers for specific components, or
your own custom code. The figure below shows the flow between processors.

image::images/message_flow_in_route.png[image]

A route starts with a consumer (i.e., `from` in the DSL) that populates the initial xref:exchange.adoc[exchange]. At each processor step, the output (out) message
from the previous step is the input (in) message of the next. In many cases, processors don’t set an out message, so in this case the in message
is reused. The xref:exchange-pattern.adoc[exchange pattern] of the exchange determines, at the end of a route, whether a reply needs to be sent back to the caller of the route.
If the exchange pattern (MEP) is `InOnly`, no reply will be sent back. If it’s `InOut`, Camel will take the out message from the last step and return it.

=== Component

xref:components::index.adoc[Components] are the main extension point in Camel.

From a programming point of view, components are fairly simple: they’re associated
with a name that’s used in a xref:uris.adoc[URI], and they act as a factory of xref:endpoint.adoc[endpoints].

For example, `FileComponent` is referred to by file in a URI, and it creates `FileEndpoint`. The endpoint
is perhaps an even more fundamental concept in Camel.

=== Endpoint

An xref:endpoint.adoc[endpoint] is the Camel abstraction that models the end of a channel through which a
system can send or receive messages.

image::images/MessageEndpointSolution.gif[image]

In Camel, you configure endpoints by using URIs, such as `file:data/inbox?delay=5000`,
and you also refer to endpoints this way. At runtime, Camel looks up an endpoint based
on the URI notation. The figure below shows how this works.

image::images/endpoint-uri-syntax.png[image]

The scheme (1) denotes which Camel component handles that type of endpoint. In
this case, the scheme of `file` selects `FileComponent`. `FileComponent` then works as a
factory, creating `FileEndpoint` based on the remaining parts of the URI. The context
path `data/inbox` (2) tells `FileComponent` that the starting folder is `data/inbox`. The
option, `delay=5000` (3) indicates that files should be polled at a 5-second interval.

The next figure shows how an endpoint works together with an exchange, producers, and consumers.

image::images/endpoint-factory.png[image]

An endpoint acts as a factory for creating consumers and producers that are capable of
receiving and sending messages to a particular endpoint.

=== Producer

A producer is the Camel abstraction that refers to an entity capable of sending a message to
an endpoint. When a message is sent to an endpoint, the producer handles the details of getting
the message data compatible with that particular endpoint. For example, `FileProducer`
will write the message body to a `java.io.File`. `JmsProducer`, on the other hand, will map
the Camel message to `javax.jms.Message` before sending it to a JMS destination. This
is an important feature in Camel, because it hides the complexity of interacting with
particular transports. All you need to do is route a message to an endpoint, and the producer
does the heavy lifting.

=== Consumer

A consumer is the service that receives messages produced by some external system,
wraps them in an xref:exchange.adoc[exchange], and sends them to be processed.
Consumers are the source of the exchanges being routed in Apache Camel.
To create a new exchange, a consumer will use the endpoint that wraps
the payload being consumed. A xref:processor.adoc[processor] is then used to initiate the routing of the
exchange in Camel via the routing engine.

Camel has two kinds of consumers: event-driven consumers, and polling consumers (or scheduled polling consumers).
The differences between these consumers are important, because they help solve different
problems.

==== Event Driven Consumer

The most familiar consumer is the event-driven consumer, as illustrated:

image::images/EventDrivenConsumerSolution.gif[image]

This kind of consumer is mostly associated with client-server architectures and web
services. It’s also referred to as an asynchronous receiver in the EIP world. An event-driven
consumer listens on a particular messaging channel, such as a TCP/IP port, JMS
queue, Twitter handle, Amazon SQS queue, WebSocket, and so on. It then waits for a
client to send messages to it. When a message arrives, the consumer wakes up and takes
the message for processing.

==== Polling Consumer / Scheduled Polling Consumer

In contrast to the event-driven consumer, the polling consumer actively goes and
fetches messages from a particular source, such as an FTP server. The polling consumer
is also known as a synchronous receiver in EIP lingo, because it won’t poll for more
messages until it’s finished processing the current message. A common flavor of the
polling consumer is the scheduled polling consumer, which polls at scheduled intervals.
File, FTP, and email components all use scheduled polling consumers.

NOTE: In the Camel components, its only either the event driven or scheduled polling consumers that
are in use. The polling consumer (non-scheduled) is only used to poll on-demand, such as
when using the xref:components:eips:pollEnrich-eip.adoc[Poll Enrich] EIP, or from Java by
creating a `PollingConsumer` instance via the `createPollingConsumer()` method from `Endpoint`.

See xref:lifecycle.adoc[Lifecycle] to understand the overall lifecycle of the `CamelContext`.
= Clustering

Camel offers the following cluster related SPI:

- *Cluster Service*
+
A regular Camel service that manages cluster resources such as _views_ (see below)

- *Cluster View*
+
Represent a view of the cluster with its own set of isolated resources. As today views provide supports for:
+
    * Leader Election
    * Topology events like members joining/leaving the cluster

- *Cluster Member*
+
Represent a member of the cluster.


== Cluster SPI Setup

A _Cluster Service_ is just like any other camel service so set it up you only need to register your implementations
to the `CamelContext`:

[source,java]
----
MyClusterServiceImpl service = new MyClusterServiceImpl();
context.addService(service);
----

The configuration of the _Cluster Service_ depends on the implementation you have chose.
Out of the box camel provides the following implementations:

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|====
|Type       |Module           | Class
|consul     |camel-consul     | org.apache.camel.component.consul.cluster.ConsulClusterService
|file       |camel-file       | org.apache.camel.component.file.cluster.FileLockClusterService
|infinispan |camel-infinispan | org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.cluster.InfinispanClusterService
|jgroups |camel-jgroups | org.apache.camel.component.jgroups.cluster.JGroupsLockClusterService
|jgroups-raft |camel-jgroups-raft | org.apache.camel.component.jgroups.raft.cluster.JGroupsRaftClusterService
|kubernetes |camel-kubernetes | org.apache.camel.component.kubernetes.cluster.KubernetesClusterService
|zookeeper  |camel-zookeeper  | org.apache.camel.component.zookeeper.cluster.ZooKeeperClusterService
|====

Configuration examples:

- *Spring Boot*
+
[source,properties]
----
camel.cluster.file.enabled = true
camel.cluster.file.id = ${random.uuid}
camel.cluster.file.root = ${java.io.tmpdir}
----

    ...
  </camelContext>

</beans>
----

== Cluster SPI Usage

The _Cluster SPI_ is leveraged by the following new implementations:

- *ClusteredRoutePolicy*
+
This is an implementation of a RoutePolicy that starts the routes it is associated to when the Cluster View it uses takes the leadership
+
[source,java]
----
context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        // Create the route policy
        RoutePolicy policy = ClusteredRoutePolicy.forNamespace("my-ns");

        // bind the policy to one or more routes
        from("timer:clustered?delay=1000&period=1000")
            .routePolicy(policy)
            .log("Route ${routeId} is running ...");
    }
});
----
+
To apply the same policy to all the routes a dedicated  _RoutePolicyFactory_ can be used:
+
[source,java]
----
// add the clustered route policy factory to context
context.addRoutePolicyFactory(ClusteredRoutePolicyFactory.forNamespace("my-ns"));

context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        // bind the policy to one or more routes
        from("timer:clustered?delay=1000&period=1000")
            .log("Route ${routeId} is running ...");
    }
});
----

- *ClusteredRouteController*
+
This is an implementation of the _RouteController SPI_ that lets the camel context start then starts/stops the routes when the leadership is taken/lost. This is well integrated with spring-boot apps so assuming you have your routes set-up like:
+
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public RouteBuilder routeBuilder() {
    return new RouteBuilder() {
        @Override
        public void configure() throws Exception {
            from("timer:heartbeat?period=10000")
                .routeId("heartbeat")
                .log("HeartBeat route (timer) ...");
            from("timer:clustered?period=5000")
                .routeId("clustered")
                .log("Clustered route (timer) ...");
        }
    };
}
----
+
You can then leverage Spring Boot configuration to make them clustered:
+
[source,properties]
----
# enable the route controller
camel.clustered.controller.enabled = true

# define the default namespace for routes
camel.clustered.controller.namespace = my-ns

# exclude the route with id 'heartbeat' from the clustered ones
camel.clustered.controller.routes[heartbeat].clustered = false
----

- *Master Component*
+
The master component is similar to a _ClusteredRoutePolicy_ but it works on consumer level so it ensures the only a single endpoint in a cluster is consuming resources at any point in time. Set it up is very easy and all you need is to prefix singleton endpoints according to the master component syntax:
+
[source,text]
----
master:namespace:delegateUri
----
+
A concrete example:
+
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public RouteBuilder routeBuilder() {
    return new RouteBuilder() {
        @Override
        public void configure() throws Exception {
            from("timer:heartbeat?period=10000")
                .routeId("heartbeat")
                .log("HeartBeat route (timer) ...");

            from("master:my-ns:timer:clustered?period=5000")
                .routeId("clustered")
                .log("Clustered route (timer) ...");
        }
    };
}
----

= Component DSL

Component-DSL is a builder API that allows using type-safe construction of Camel xref:component.adoc[Components] and injecting them directly to the xref:camelcontext.adoc[Camel Context] instead of initializing through a constructor.

The Component DSL is exclusively available as part of the Java DSL.

== Using Component DSL

The following is an example of a Kafka component that is constructed using the typical constructor initialization:

[source,java]
----
KafkaComponent kafka = new KafkaComponent();
kafka.setBrokers("localhost:9090");

camelContext.addComponent("kafka", kafka);
----

The same Java statement can be rewritten in the following more readable way using the new `ComponentsBuilderFactory` that allows the access to all component DSLs in Camel:

[source,java]
----
ComponentsBuilderFactory.kafka()
                        .brokers("{{kafka.host}}:{{kafka.port}}")
                        .register(camelContext, "kafka");
----

In order to explain it better, we can break down the above Java statement into 3 parts:

. `ComponentsBuilderFactory.kafka()`: This will initialize the DSL for `camel-kafka` component.
. `.brokers("{{kafka.host}}:{{kafka.port}}")`: This is the equivalent setter of `kafka.setBrokers("localhost:9090")` using DSL fluent builder.
. `.register(camelContext, "kafka")`: Here we register directly the component under name `kafka` into Camel context, of course you can use any component name you like, just like `addComponent` API. 

=== Type Safety

Similar to the xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL], uses the meta-model, which is extracted from the source and
written in various JSON files, to generate a fluent DSL for each component. This fluent DSL provides type safety for parameters.


== Dependency

In order to use this feature, Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-componentdsl</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----

And then use it just like how we demonstrated it earlier in this page.
= Components

Components are a fundamental building block of Apache Camel and are used to connect routes to a wide variety of external systems and services. Camel comes with a large number of built-in components that provide connectivity to a wide range of technologies and protocols, such as HTTP, JMS, file, and many others. You can also create a custom components if the built-in components do not meet your needs.

== Components: the basics

A Component is essentially a factory of Endpoint instances. Typically, applications shouldn't need to interact directly with a component. However, there are some circumstances where manipulating the component may be beneficial for the performance, operation, or scalability of the application. In such cases, these applications may use the context to get access to an instance of the endpoint they need to manipulate. The applications can do so by using the method `CamelContext.getEndpoint()`. This method returns an implementation of the `Component` interface that is appropriate for the component requested. For instance, consider the following code:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3://john.smith@mailserv.example.com?password=myPassword");
----

For the URI given in the above example, the `CamelContext` object would map the `pop3` prefix to an instance of the `MailComponent` class.

The parameter to `getEndpoint()` is a URI. The URI _scheme_ (that is,
the part before `:`) specifies the name of a component. Internally, the `CamelContext` object maintains a mapping from the names of components to `Component` objects.

== Configuring Component Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example, a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre-configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

== Configuring Endpoint Options

Typically, you want to configure endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to configure what you need the endpoint to do. These endpoint options are also categorized according to the type of endpoint:

* consumer (_from_)
* producer (_to_)
* or both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allow us to avoid using hardcoded urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words, with placeholders you can externalize the configuration from your code, thus obtaining more flexibility and reuse.

=== How Camel maps names to components

In the getting started guide, we explained that Camel maintains a map of names to components. This raises the question of how Camel populates this map with named `Component` objects.

[NOTE]
====
Normally, application developers don't need to worry about this. However, this information is fundamental if you are writing a custom component.
====

There are two ways of populating the map.

* Programmatically, using the context
* Via lazy-initialization

=== Programmatically

The programmatic way is for application-level code to invoke `CamelContext.addComponent(String componentName, Component component)`.

The example below shows a single `MailComponent` object being registered in the map under 3 different names.

[source,java]
----
Component mailComponent = new org.apache.camel.component.mail.MailComponent();
myCamelContext.addComponent("pop3", mailComponent);
myCamelContext.addComponent("imap", mailComponent);
myCamelContext.addComponent("smtp", mailComponent);
----

=== Lazy-initialization

The second (and preferred) way to populate the map of named `Component` objects in the `CamelContext` object is to let the `CamelContext` object perform lazy initialization.

This approach relies on developers following a convention when they write a class that implements the `Component` interface. For instance, let's assume you write a class called `com.example.myproject.FooComponent` and you want Camel to automatically recognize this by the name `foo`. To do this, you write a properties file called `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo` (without a `.properties` file extension) that has a single entry in it called `class`, the value of which is the fully-scoped name of your class. For instance:

.META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo
[source]
----
class=com.example.myproject.FooComponent
----

If you want Camel to also recognize the class by the name `bar` then you write another properties file in the same directory called `bar` that has the same contents. Once you have written the properties file(s), you create a JAR file that contains the `com.example.myproject.FooComponent` class and the properties file(s), and you add this jar file to your CLASSPATH. Then, when application-level code invokes `createEndpoint("foo:...")` on a `CamelContext` object, Camel will find the "foo"" properties file on the CLASSPATH, get the value of the `class` property from that properties file, and use reflection APIs to create an instance of the specified class.

Camel provides out-of-the-box support for various communication technologies. This support consists of classes that implement the `Component` interface plus properties files that enable a `CamelContext` object to populate its map of named `Component`
objects.

Earlier in this guide, we provided the following example of calling `CamelContext.getEndpoint()`:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3://john.smith@mailserv.example.com?password=myPassword");
----

We originally referred to the parameter as a URI because the online Camel documentation and the Camel source code both claim the parameter is a URI. In reality, the parameter is restricted to being a URL. This is because when Camel extracts the component name from the parameter, it looks for the first ":", which is a simplistic algorithm.

[NOTE]
====
Remember that in the xref:camel-core:getting-started:index.adoc[Getting Started With Camel] we explained that a URI could be a URL or a URN.
====

Now consider the following calls to `getEndpoint`:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("jms:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("urn:foo:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("urn:bar:...");
----

Camel identifies the components in the above example as `pop3`, `jms`, `urn`, and `urn`. It would be more useful if the latter components were identified as `urn:foo` and `urn:bar` or as `foo` and `bar` (that is, by skipping over the `urn:` prefix). So, in practice, you must identify an endpoint with a URL (a string of the form `<scheme>:...`) rather than with a URN (a string of the form `urn:<scheme>:...`). This lack of proper support for URNs means that you should consider the parameter to the method `getEndpoint()` as being a URL rather than (as claimed) a URI.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to read xref:faq:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints?]
to learn more about configuring endpoints. For example, how to refer to beans in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] or how
to use raw values for password options, and using xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders] etc.
====

== Component DSL

Component-DSL is a builder API that allows using type-safe construction of Camel Components and injecting them directly to the xref:camelcontext.adoc[Camel Context] instead of initializing through a constructor.

** xref:manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL]

== Writing Components

This is an advanced topic and described in more detail in the xref:writing-components.adoc[Writing Components Guide].

== See Also

- List of all Camel xref:components::index.adoc[Components]
= Configuring Routes Startup Ordering and Auto-startup

Camel supports configuring two aspects:

* auto-startup
* order of starting routes

== Auto-startup

The `autoStartup` option allows is to configure
Camel to *not* auto start routes when Camel starts.

The auto startup can be configured on two levels:

- Camel context: _Globally_
- Route: _Individually per route_

For example, the xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] below we have configured `autoStartup=false` to
prevent Camel starting all the routes on startup.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="myCamel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"
              autoStartup="false">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:foo"/>
    </route>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:bar"/>
        <to uri="mock:bar"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

So how do you start the routes?

The `autoStartup` option on the `<camelContext>` is only used once, so you
can manually start Camel later by invoking its `start` method in Java as shown
below.

For example, when using Spring, you can get hold of the `CamelContext` via
the Spring `ApplicationContext`:

[source,java]
----
ApplicationContext ac = ...
CamelContext camel = ac.getBean("myCamel", CamelContext.class);

// now start all the routes
camel.getRouteController().startAllRoutes();
----

TIP: The routes can also be started via JMX (requires `camel-management` JAR to be on the classpath) by invoking the `startAllRoutes` operation on the CamelContext MBean.

=== Auto-startup per route level

You can also use the `autoStartup` option to configure if a given route
should be started when Camel starts. By default, a route is auto started.

In XML DSL, you disable auto startup as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<route autoStartup="false">
   <from uri="activemq:queue:special"/>
   <to uri="file://backup"/>
</route>
----

And to explicit state it should be started:

[source,xml]
----
<route autoStartup="true">
   <from uri="activemq:queue:special"/>
   <to uri="file://backup"/>
</route>
----

And in Java DSL you can configure auto startup on `CamelContext` as follows:

[source,java]
----
camelContext.setAutoStartup(false);
----

And on route level you can disable it via `noAutoStartup`:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:queue:special").noAutoStartup()
    .to("file://backup");
----

To startup based on a boolean, String or
xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Property], do one of the following:

[source,java]
----
// using a boolean
from("activemq:queue:special").autoStartup(false)
    .to("file://backup");

// using a string
from("activemq:queue:special").autoStartup("false")
    .to("file://backup");

// using property placeholders
from("activemq:queue:special").autoStartup("{{startupRouteProperty}}")
    .to("file://backup");
----

== Configuring starting order for routes

You can also configure the order in which routes are started.
Previously,
Camel started the routes in a non-deterministic order.
Now you have
fine-grained control in which order the routes should be started.
There is a
new attribute `startupOrder` which is an `Integer` that states the order.
Camel then sorts the routes before starting time.
The routes with the lowest `startupOrder` are started first, and the ones with the highest are
started last.

IMPORTANT: All `startupOrder` defined must be unique among all routes in your
xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext]. Otherwise, if there are clashes in
`startupOrder` numbers among routes, the routes will fail to start up throwing
`org.apache.camel.FailedToStartRouteException`.

Normally you should also use numbers that are lower than 1000, as routes without
an explicit `startupOrder` definition will have a number starting from 1000
auto assigned. So view numbers from 1000 upwards as reserved internally
for Camel itself.

However, you can also use higher numbers than 1000
(to avoid collisions with those auto assigned numbers) to specify the last routes
to start up. Normally, the usage of numbers starting from 10000 should be safe
for the purpose.

In terms of the `startupOrder` there are no strict rules that it must
start from 1 and increment by 1.
You can, for example, use: 100, 200, 205, 89 if you like.
The only rule of thumb is that the numbers must be unique.

=== Why do you want to control the starting order?

It can help in cases where routes are inter-dependent on each other and
also help with graceful shutting down Camel as Camel can stop the routes
in the correct order as well.

Apache Camel will stop the routes in the *reverse* order that they were started.

Let's try a couple of examples.

=== Startup ordering example

[source,java]
----
from("seda:foo").startupOrder(1)
    .to("mock:result");

from("direct:start").startupOrder(2)
    .to("seda:foo");
----

And the same example with XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route startupOrder="1">
        <from uri="seda:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

    <route startupOrder="2">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="seda:foo"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

In this example, we have two routes in which we have started that the
direct:start route should be started *after* the seda:foo route.
Because direct:start is considered the input, and we want seda:foo
route to be up and running beforehand.

=== Using startOrder together with non startOrder

You can also mix and match routes with and without `startupOrder` defined.
The first two routes below have start order defined, and the last route has not.

[source,java]
----
from("seda:foo").startupOrder(1)
    .to("mock:result");

from("direct:start").startupOrder(2)
    .to("seda:foo");

from("direct:bar")
    .to("seda:bar");
----

And the same example with XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route startupOrder="1">
        <from uri="seda:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

    <route startupOrder="2">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="seda:foo"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:bar"/>
        <to uri="seda:bar"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

In the route above we have *not* defined a `startupOrder` on the last
route direct:bar in which Camel will auto assign a number for it, in
which this case will be 1000.
Therefore, the route will be started last.

So you can use this to your advantage to only assign a `startupOrder` on
the routes which really needs it.

=== Configuring routes to start up last

You can use a high number in `startupOrder` to have a specific route startup last as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// use auto assigned startup ordering
from("direct:start").to("seda:foo");

// should start first
from("seda:foo").startupOrder(1).to("mock:result");

// should start last after the default routes
from("direct:bar").startupOrder(12345).to("seda:bar");

// use auto assigned startup ordering
from("seda:bar").to("mock:other");
----

In the example above, the order of route startups should be:

1. `_seda:foo_`
2. `_direct:start_`
3. `_seda:bar_`
4. `_direct:bar_`

=== Shutting down routes

Apache Camel will shut down the routes in the *reverse* order that they were started.

See more at xref:graceful-shutdown.adoc[Graceful Shutdown].

= ConsumerTemplate

The `ConsumerTemplate` interface allows you to receive message exchanges from
endpoints in a variety of different ways to make it easy to work with
Camel xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] instances from Java code.

It can be configured with a default endpoint if you just want to receive
lots of messages to the same endpoint; or you can specify an
xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] or uri as the first parameter.

The `receiveBody()` method allows you to receive any object to an endpoint
easily as shown:

[source,java]
----
ConsumerTemplate template = exchange.getContext().createConsumerTemplate();

// recieve from default endpoint
Object body = template.receiveBody();

// receive from a specific queue
body = template.receiveBody("activemq:MyQueue");
----

== Receive modes

The consumer template operates in three modes:

- **receive** - Consumes from the endpoint, waiting until there is a message (can potentially wait for a long time!).
- **receiveNoWait** - Consumes from endpoint, not waiting for a message if none exists.
- **receiveTimeout** - Consumes from the endpoint, waiting until there is a response, or the timeout occurs.

In the previous examples then it was the first mode we used (`receiveBody`).
For example if there are no messages on the `activemq:MyQueue` then Camel would wait until a message is sent to this queue.

Often you dont want to wait _forever_ so its often a good idea to use a timeout value, such as 5 seconds:

[source,java]
----
ConsumerTemplate template = exchange.getContext().createConsumerTemplate();

// receive from a specific queue
body = template.receiveBody("activemq:MyQueue", 5000);
----

Here we wait at most 5 seconds for a message to be consumed, if there was no message, then `null` is returned as response.

See xref:producertemplate.adoc[ProducerTemplate]= Context Reload

The context reload functionality in Camel is capable of reloading all existing routes and property placeholders
upon an external triggered event.

For example, if you are using xref:components::aws-secrets-manager-component.adoc[AWS Secrets], then
enabling context-reload would then reload Camel routes upon a secret is updated in AWS.

The context reload is limited to refresh the following on reload:

- xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders]
- all existing xref:routes.adoc[routes] (no changes to structure of routes; see xref:route-reload.adoc[]])

General services in xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] and java beans or Camel xref:processor.adoc[] is not updated.

== Using context reloading

The context reloading can be configured in Java or with Spring Boot, Quarkus in the following way:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...

ContextReloadStrategy reload = new DefaultContextReloadStrategy();
context.addService(reload);
----

And with Camel Quarkus / Camel Main you can configure this in `application.properties:`

[source,properties]
----
# turn on context reloading
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
----

And in Spring Boot:

[source,properties]
----
# turn on context reloading
camel.springboot.context-reload-enabled = true
----

== Triggering context reloading

Any custom code can trigger context reloading. This is done by ensuring the context reload is enabled (see the note above), and
then from Java you can get hold of `ContextReloadStrategy` as follows:

[source,java]
----
ContextReloadStrategy reload = context.hasService(ContextReloadStrategy.class);
if (reload != null) {
    // trigger reload
    reload.onReload(this);
}
----

The method `onReload` will then reload all the xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders] and
then afterward reload all existing xref:routes.adoc[routes].

= CronScheduledRoutePolicy

`CronScheduledRoutePolicy` is a
xref:scheduledroutepolicy.adoc[ScheduledRoutePolicy] that facilitates
route activation, deactivation, suspension and resumption of routes
based on a xref:components::quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] cron trigger.

[TIP]
====
.Relationship to the Quartz component

All Scheduled route policies share the scheduler created by the xref:components::quartz-component.adoc[Quartz]
component. In this way, scheduler, jobs and triggers can be managed in a
common and consistent way.
====

== Using cron scheduled route policy

To use a `CronScheduledRoutePolicy` it is
necessary to instantiate an object of the type
`org.apache.camel.routepolicy.quartz.CronScheduledRoutePolicy`.

To perform a route operation at a given time, the following
information must be provided.

=== Starting a route

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|routeStartTime |String |  |the initial scheduled date and time as a
Cron Expression for route start
|=======================================================================

=== Stopping a route

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|routeStopTime |String |  |the initial scheduled date and time as a Cron
Expression for route stop

|routeStopGracePeriod |int |10000 |the time period to wait before
initiating graceful route stop

|routeStopTimeUnit |long |TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS |the time unit for the
grace period expressed as `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit`
|=======================================================================

=== Suspending a route

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|routeSuspendTime |String |  |the initial scheduled date and time as a
Cron Expression for route suspension
|=======================================================================

=== Resuming a route

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter Name |Type |Default Value |Description
|routeResumeTime |String |  |the initial scheduled date and time as a
Cron Expression for route resumption
|=======================================================================

== Configuring the route policy

Once the `org.apache.camel.routepolicy.quartz.CronScheduledRoutePolicy`
is created it can be wired into the Camel route as follows:

In Java:

[source,java]
----
CronScheduledRoutePolicy startPolicy = new CronScheduledRoutePolicy();
startPolicy.setRouteStartTime("*/3 * * * * ?");
                
from("direct:start")
    .routeId("testRoute").routePolicy(startPolicy).noAutoStartup()
    .to("mock:success");
----

And with Spring XML:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="startPolicy" class="org.apache.camel.routepolicy.quartz.CronScheduledRoutePolicy">
    <property name="routeStartTime" value="*/3 * * * * ?"/>
</bean>
    
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route id="testRoute" routePolicyRef="startPolicy" autoStartup="false">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="mock:success"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

IMPORTANT: Notice how the route to be scheduled *MUST* be configured to not
xref:configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.adoc[auto-startup], to let
the route scheduler take control of starting and stopping the route accordingly.

=== Dependency

Maven users will need to add a camel-quartz dependency to their
`pom.xml` to avail this capability.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quartz</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----
= Data Format

Camel supports a pluggable `DataFormat` to allow messages to be marshalled
to and from binary or text formats to support a kind of
xref:components:eips:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator].

image::images/MessageTranslator.gif[image]

Camel has support for message transformation using several techniques.
One such technique is data formats, where marshal and unmarshal comes from.

So in other words, the xref:components:eips:marshal-eip.adoc[Marshal] and
xref:components:eips:unmarshal-eip.adoc[Unmarshal] EIPs
are used data formats.

- _Marshal_ - Transforms the message body (such as Java object) into a binary or textual format, ready to be wired over the network.
- _Unmarshal_ - Transforms data in some binary or textual format (such as received over the network)
into a Java object; or some other representation according to the data format being used.

== Supported data formats

There are more than 40 different data formats that
support formats such as XML, CSV, JSON, YAML, Avro, Protobuf, and many more.

== Example

See xref:components:eips:marshal-eip.adoc[Marshal] for more information and examples.

== See Also

** xref:manual::dataformat-dsl.adoc[Data Format DSL]
= Data Format DSL

The Data Format DSL is a builder API that allows using type safe construction of
Camel xref:data-format.adoc[Data Formats].

The Data Format DSL is exclusively available as part of the Java DSL.

The DSL can be accessed directly from the `RouteBuilder` thanks to the method `dataFormat()`.

== Using Data Format DSL

In the following example, a `CsvDataFormat` is created using the legacy approach where the data format is instantiated explicitly and configured using setters:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        CsvDataFormat dataFormat = new CsvDataFormat(); // <1>
        dataFormat.setDelimiter("|"); // <2>
        from("direct:format")
            .setBody(constant(Map.of("foo", "abc", "bar", 123)))
            .marshal(dataFormat); // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> Instantiate the expected data format
<2> Configure the data format according to the needs
<3> Affect the data format with the expected configuration

The previous code could be simplified using the utility methods available directly from the `DataFormatClause` corresponding to the type returned by the `marshal()` and `unmarshal()` methods:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("direct:format")
            .setBody(constant(Map.of("foo", "abc", "bar", 123)))
            .marshal()
            .csv(); // <1>
    }
}
----
<1> Select the `csv` data format with the default delimiter

This approach is suitable for very basic configuration, but as there are only limited utility methods for each supported data format, for more complex configuration, we can quickly face situations where the utility method for our expected configuration doesn't exist. In this situation, you can either use the legacy approach or the data format DSL like in the next code snippet:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("direct:format")
            .setBody(constant(Map.of("foo", "abc", "bar", 123)))
            .marshal(
                dataFormat() // <1>
                    .csv() // <2>
                        .delimiter(",") // <3>
                    .end() // <4>
            );
    }
}
----
<1> Give access to all the supported data formats
<2> Select the `csv` data format
<3> Configure the data format according to the needs
<4> Build the data format with the expected configuration
= Debugger

The Camel Debugger is intended for third party tooling to make it possible to
debug routes, trace messages and to use breakpoints with the EIP patterns in the Camel routes.

The Debugger allows tooling or the likes to attach breakpoints which are
being invoked when xref:exchange.adoc[Exchanges] are routed.

== Java Debugging Camel routes in unit tests

If you are developing unit tests using the `camel-test-junit5` component, then
the Debugger is available if you turn it on via overriding the `isUseDebugger()`
method and return `true`.

In this unit test

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
public class DebugTest extends CamelTestSupport
-----------------------------------------------

We want to debug the following route

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
@Override
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
    return new RouteBuilder() {
        @Override
        public void configure() throws Exception {
            // this is the route we want to debug
            from("direct:start")
                .to("mock:a")
                .transform(body().prepend("Hello "))
                .to("mock:b");
        }
    };
}
-----------------------------------------------

Which can easily done by overriding the `debugBefore` method as shown

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
@Override
public boolean isUseDebugger() {
    // must enable debugger
    return true;
}
 
@Override
protected void debugBefore(Exchange exchange, Processor processor,
                           ProcessorDefinition<?> definition, String id, String shortName) {
    // this method is invoked before we are about to enter the given processor
    // from your Java editor you can just add a breakpoint in the code line below
    log.info("Before " + definition + " with body " + exchange.getIn().getBody());
}
-----------------------------------------------

Then from your Java editor just add a breakpoint inside the
`debugBefore` method. Then fire up the unit test and wait for the Java
editor to hit the breakpoint. Then you can inspect the
Exchange during debugging while it advances during
routing. The `ProcessorDefinition` and the `id` and `shortName`
parameters is all information which tells you where in the route the
breakpoint was hit. 

TIP: There is also a `debugAfter` method which is invoked after the processor
has been invoked. This allows you to _see_ what happens to the
Exchange right after it has invoked a processor in the route.

The screenshot below shows the Debugger in action.
The IDE (IDEA) has hit the breakpoint, and we can inspect the
parameters. Notice how we can see that the message is to be sent to the mock:a
endpoint.

image::images/debug.png[image]

=== Java debugging of Camel routes written with Java DSL

A trick to debug a Camel route written with Java DSL is to modify the route to insert a `processor` and then to set the breakpoint in it.

For instance:

=== Implementing a custom debugger

The debugger API is defined in `org.apache.camel.spi.Debugger`.
This API has methods to attach and remove breakpoints.

And to suspend/resume all breakpoints etc.
You can also attach a condition to the breakpoint, so it only reacts if
the condition matches.

Camel provides a base implementation `org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultDebugger`,
which can be used to extend for custom implementations.

=== Camel Route debugger through JMX

There is also a xref:backlog-debugger.adoc[Backlog Debugger] that allows debugging from JMX.
It is automatically provided when `camel-debug` is on the classpath (since 3.16) or when
using the `camel:debug` Maven goal (since 3.18).

To be able to have enough time to add your breakpoints, since 3.18, you could need to suspend the message processing of Camel to make sure
that you won't miss any messages. For this kind of need, you have to set either the environment variable `CAMEL_DEBUGGER_SUSPEND` or the system property `org.apache.camel.debugger.suspend` to `true` within the context of your application, then the `Backlog Debugger` suspends the message processing until the JMX operation `attach` is called. Calling the JMX operation `detach` suspends again the message processing.

In case the environment variable and the system property are both set, the value of the environment variable is used.

Several third-party tools are using it:

* https://hawt.io/[hawtio] uses this for its web-based debugging functionality
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel[VS Code Debug Adapter for Camel]
* http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textual-debugging-apache-camel[Eclipse Desktop Debug Adapter for Camel]
* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9371-apache-camel[IntelliJ Camel plugin]
* https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-debug-adapter[Debug Adapter Server for Camel]

Camel requires to have `camel-management` JAR on the classpath for having JMX enabled.

= DefaultErrorHandler

This is the default xref:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler] in Camel.

The default xref:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler] has the same power
as the xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel.]
However, it does *not* support a _dead letter queue_, which is
the only difference between the two of them.

The `DefaultErrorHandler` is configured differently from
xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] as
it is configured to:

* not redeliver
* not handled
* no dead letter queue (because it is not possible)

By default, any exception thrown during routing will be propagated back
to the caller and the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] ends immediately.
However, you can use the xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] to
catch a given exception and lower the exception by marking it as
handled. If so, the exception will *not* be sent back to the caller, and
the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] will succeed, but *not continue* being routed.
See the _difference_ between `handled` and `continued` in the
xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] documentation.

== Example

In this route below, any exception thrown in, such as the `validateOrder`
bean, will be propagated back to the caller via the jetty endpoint, which
then returns an HTTP error message back to the client.

[source,java]
----
from("jetty:http://localhost/myservice/order")
  .to("bean:validateOrder")
  .to("jms:queue:order");
----

We can add an `onException` in case we want to catch certain exceptions
and route them differently, for instance to catch a
`ValidationException` and return a fixed response to the caller.

[source,java]
----
onException(ValidationException.class)
  .handled(true)
  .transform(body(constant("INVALID ORDER")));

from("jetty:http://localhost/myservice/order")
  .to("bean:validateOrder")
  .to("jms:queue:order");
----

When the `ValidationException` is thrown from the `validateOrder` bean,
it is intercepted by Camel error handler which lets the
`onException(ValidationException.class)` handle the exception.
The xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is routed to this onException route, and
since we use `handled(true)`, then the original exception is cleared,
and we transform the message into a fixed response that is returned to
jetty endpoint that returns it to the original caller.

= Delayer

The Delayer is used for slowing processing of messages.

This allows you to set a fixed amount of delay between each step a message passes in
the route.
It can be used to better show how things are happening nicely and slowly, so you
are not bombarded with a zillion lines of logging output.

== Using Delayer

The delayer can be configured on two levels:

- Camel context: _Globally_
- Route: _Individually per route_

=== Configuring using XML DSL

Set the `delayer` attribute of the `<camelContext>` tag as shown below:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext id="camel" delayer="500" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Configuring using Java

You can enable delaying messages by setting the delay value on the `CamelContext` as shown:

[source,java]
-----------------------------
camelContext.setDelayer(200);
-----------------------------

=== Configuring on route level

You can also configure it on both camel context and per route
as you like. Per route will override the camel context setting.

For example, the route below is only the first route that has a delayer with 200 milliseconds.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
   <route delayer="200">
     ...
   </route>

   <route>
     ...
   </route>
</camelContext>
----

And in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").delayer(200)
    .to("mock:result")
----

= DSL

Camel uses a Java _Domain Specific Language_ or DSL for creating
xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] or xref:routes.adoc[Routes] in a variety of domain-specific
languages (DSL) as listed below:

* xref:java-dsl.adoc[Java DSL]: a Java-based DSL using the fluent builder style.
* xref:components:others:java-xml-io-dsl.adoc[XML DSL]: an XML-based DSL in Camel XML files only.
* xref:components::spring-summary.adoc[Spring XML]: an XML-based DSL in classic Spring XML files.
* xref:components:others:yaml-dsl.adoc[YAML DSL]: for creating routes using YAML format.
* xref:rest-dsl.adoc[Rest DSL]: a DSL to define REST services using REST verbs.
** xref:rest-dsl-openapi.adoc[Rest DSL contract first]: rest DSL using _contract-first_ when OpenAPI specs.
* xref:bean-integration.adoc[Annotation DSL]: Use annotations in Java beans.

== See Also

* xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] the main entry for Camel is the `CamelContext`
* xref:routes.adoc[Routes] for general information about a Camel route

= Component Endpoint Annotations

You can annotate xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] and xref:component.adoc[Component]
classes, so that their configuration documentation can be
automatically generated by Maven tooling via the
xref:camel-component-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Component Maven Plugin]
into the `src/main/generated` folder.

The documentation is then included into the jar as JSON schema files.

The Camel project uses this to automatic keep the website documentation up-to-date
with all the latest options on the Camel xref:components::index.adoc[Components].

== Supported Annotations

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Annotation |Description
|`@UriEndpoint` |Specifies that an endpoint is annotated with `@UriParam`
and/or `@UriParams` annotations. Also specifies the default scheme to use
in the generated documentation, and other information.

|`@UriParam` |Used to annotate a parameter value; usually specified via
?foo=bar syntax in the URI strings in Camel. Used currently only on
field declarations but in the future could be used on setter methods
too. If no name is specified then the name of the field/setter property
is used.

|`@UriParams` |Specifies that a field is a nested object of one or more
configuration parameters; then the class of this field should be
annotated with one or more `@UriParam` or `@UriParams` annotations

|`@Metadata` | Used for special situations to provide additional information.
|=======================================================================

For example see the `TimerEndpoint` from the `camel-timer` component and
notice how it is using these annotations.

The annotations are not only useful for automatically generating the
documentation; we can use them to refine the validation of the code
during configuration and can be useful for tooling providers, so they
can more easily introspect the configuration options.

= Endpoint DSL

Endpoint-DSL is a builder API that allows using type-safe endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URL] configurations.

The Endpoint DSL is exclusively available as part of the Java DSL.

The DSL can be accessed in several ways, but the main one is to switch to using an `EndpointRouteBuilder` instead of the usual
`RouteBuilder`. This builder provides access to all of Camel endpoint builders which are defined through inheritance on the `org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.EndpointRouteBuilder`.

== Using Endpoint DSL

The following is an example of an FTP route using the standard `RouteBuilder` Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("ftp://foo@myserver?password=secret&recursive=true&" +
                "ftpClient.dataTimeout=30000&" +
                "ftpClientConfig.serverLanguageCode=fr")
                .to("bean:doSomething");
    }
}
----

The same Java statement can be rewritten in the following more type-safe and readable way using
the new `EndpointRouteBuilder` that allows using the Endpoint-DSL:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends EndpointRouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from(ftp("myserver").account("foo").password("secret").recursive(true)
            .advanced()
                .ftpClientParameters(Collections.singletonMap("dataTimeout", 30000))
                .ftpClientConfig(Collections.singletonMap("serverLanguageCode", "fr")))
            .to(bean("something"));
    }
}
----

=== Type Safety

Similar to the xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], uses the meta-model, which is extracted from the source and
written in various JSON files, to generate a fluent DSL for each component. This fluent DSL provides type safety for parameters.

=== Using custom component names

The Endpoint-DSL uses the default name of the xref:component.adoc[Component], so in the example above the name is `ftp`.
There can be use-cases where you may have multiple Camel xref:components::index.adoc[components] of the same type registered with different names.
An example is if you have two JMS broker systems (for example ActiveMQ and WebSphereMQ).

Then you can set up two Camel JMS components with unique names such as: `myAMQ` and `myWMQ`

The Endpoint-DSL can use these names with the `jms` fluent builder as shown:

[source,java]
----
from(jms("myWMQ", "cheese").concurrentConsumers(5))
    .to(jms("myAMQ", "smelly"));
----

Notice how we can refer to their names as the first parameter in the `jms` fluent builder.
The example would then consume messages from WebSphereMQ queue named cheese and route to ActiveMQ on a queue named smelly.

=== Headers' name

The endpoint-dsl can also be used to be assisted when selecting the name of a header to set or to get. The headers' name builder
is accessible directly from the method of the class `EndpointRouteBuilder` without argument whose name is the scheme of
the target component.

In the example below the method `file()` available from `EndpointRouteBuilder`, gives access to the methods corresponding to the name of the headers of the file component. Here the method `fileName()` is called to get the name of the header for the name of the file.

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends EndpointRouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from(/*some endpoint*/)
            // Some route start
            .setHeader(file().fileName(), constant("foo.txt"))
            // Some route end
            ;
    }
}
----

=== Using Endpoint-DSL outside route builders

You can use the type-safe endpoint-dsl outside route builders with:

* With the `FluentProducerTemplate` to send messages
* Creating an `Endpoint`

For example to send a message to Kafka you can use the `FluentProducerTemplate`

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.kafka;

context.createFluentProducerTemplate()
    .to(kafka("start").clientId("myClient").brokers("{{myBrokers}}").partitionKey("myKey"))
    .withBody("Hello World")
    .send();
----

To use the endpoint-dsl with kafka you need to static import `kafka` from the class:
`org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders` which has all the Camel components.

An endpoint can also be created in Java code via the endpoint-dsl as shown:

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.paho;

Endpoint mqtt = paho("sensor").clientId("myClient").userName("scott").password("tiger")
    .resolve(context);
----

You can then set all the options via the type-safe DSL and then the endpoint can be resolved (created)
by calling `resolve` with `CamelContext` as parameter.

If you want to inject an endpoint into your POJO or `RouteBuilder` class using endpoint-dsl, then
this can be done similar to the previous example, but with one important difference:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry;
import org.apache.camel.EndpointInject;
import org.apache.camel.Produce;
import org.apache.camel.builder.EndpointProducerBuilder;
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.paho;

@BindToRegistry
public class MyPojo {

    @Produce
    private FluentProducerTemplate producer;

    private final EndpointProducerBuilder mqtt = paho("sensor").clientId("myClient").userName("scott").password("tiger");

    public void sendToSensor(String data) {
        producer.withBody(data).to(mqtt).send();
    }

}
----

The `MyPojo` is a class that with standalone Camel can be discovered and registered with the `@BindToRegistry` annotation.
If you use Spring Boot, or Quarkus etc then you should use their kind of annotations for this.

That's not the point of this example, it is the Endpoint DSL to configure the MQTT endpoint (camel-paho).
The endpoint is configured the same way as before by the type-safe endpoint-dsl by static importing the `paho`,
and then use its fluent builder methods to configure. Notice how the returned type is `EndpointProducerBuilder`.
That type is not an `Endpoint` instance as it's not resolved (i.e. it's only a builder for an endpoint).
This means that the builder can be code and compiled before `CamelContext` is created and started.

At runtime, we want to use this endpoint to send messages to MQTT server; this is done in the `sendToSensor`
method where we are using `FluentProducerTemplate` that is capable of using the `EndpointProducerBuilder` as
the endpoint in shown with: `.to(mqtt)`.


== Dependency

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-endpointdsl</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----
= Endpoints

Camel supports the xref:components:eips:message-endpoint.adoc[Message Endpoint] pattern
using the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface.

Endpoints are created by a xref:component.adoc[Component] and these endpoints are referred
to in the xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] via their endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URIs].

== Example

The following example route demonstrates the use of a xref:components::file-component.adoc[File]
consumer endpoint and a * xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] producer endpoint,
by their xref:manual::uris.adoc[URIs]:

[source,java]
----
from("file:messages/foo")
    .to("jms:queue:foo");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="file:messages/foo"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
</route>
----

== Endpoint API

You will almost never have the need for creating endpoints manually via Java API.

From an `Endpoint` you can use the following Java API methods to create producers or consumers to the endpoint:

* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createProducer--[`createProducer()`]
will create a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Producer.html[Producer]
for sending message exchanges to the endpoint.

* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createConsumer-org.apache.camel.Processor[`createConsumer()`]
implements the xref:components:eips:eventDrivenConsumer-eip.adoc[Event Driven Consumer]
pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
when creating a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Consumer.html[Consumer].

* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createPollingConsumer[`createPollingConsumer()`]
implements the xref:components:eips:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling Consumer] pattern for
consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/PollingConsumer.html[PollingConsumer].

= Error Handler

Camel supports pluggable
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-base/current/org/apache/camel/processor/ErrorHandler.html[ErrorHandler]
strategies to deal with errors processing an xref:components:eips:eventDrivenConsumer-eip.adoc[Event Driven Consumer].

An alternative is to specify the error handling directly in the xref:dsl.adoc[DSL]
using the xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause].

== Exception Clause

Using Error Handler combined with
Exception Clause is a very powerful
combination. We encourage end-users to use this combination in your
error handling strategies. See samples and
Exception Clause.

== Using try ... catch ... finally

Related to error handling is the xref:try-catch-finally.adoc[Try Catch
Finally] as DSL you can use directly in your route. Its basically a
mimic of the regular try catch finally in the Java language but with
more power.

The current implementations Camel provides out of the box are:

== Non transacted

* DefaultErrorHandler is the default
error handler in Camel. This error handler does not support a dead
letter queue, it will propagate exceptions back to the caller, as if
there were no error handler at all. It has a limited set of features.
* Dead Letter Channel which supports
attempting to redeliver the message exchange a number of times before
sending it to a dead letter endpoint
* NoErrorHandler for no error handling

== Transacted

* TransactionErrorHandler is the
default error handler in Camel for transacted routes. See the
Transactional Client EIP pattern.

These error handlers can be applied in the DSL to an
entire set of rules or a specific routing rule as we show in the next
examples. Error handling rules are inherited on each routing rule within
a single RouteBuilder

== Short Summary of the provided Error Handlers

=== DefaultErrorHandler

The DefaultErrorHandler is the default
error handler in Camel. Unlike xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter
Channel] it does not have any dead letter queue, and do *not* handle
exceptions by default.

=== Dead Letter Channel

The Dead Letter Channel will redeliver at
most 6 times using 1 second delay, and if the exchange failed it will be
logged at ERROR level.

You can configure the default dead letter endpoint to use:
or in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<camel:errorHandler id="deadLetterErrorHandler" type="DeadLetterChannel" deadLetterUri="log:dead">

<camel:camelContext errorHandlerRef="deadLetterErrorHandler">
  ...
</camel:camelContext>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== No Error Handler

The no error handler is to be used for disabling error handling.

[source,java]
-------------------------------
errorHandler(noErrorHandler());
-------------------------------

or in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------
<camel:errorHandler id="noErrorHandler" type="NoErrorHandler"/>

<camel:camelContext errorHandlerRef="noErrorHandler">
  ...
</camel:camelContext>
---------------------------------------------------------------

=== TransactionErrorHandler

The TransactionErrorHandler is the
default error handler in Camel for transacted routes.

TIP: If you have marked a route as transacted using the *transacted* DSL then
Camel will automatically use a
TransactionErrorHandler. It will try
to lookup the global/per route configured error handler and use it if
it is a `TransactionErrorHandlerBuilder` instance. If not Camel will
automatically create a temporary
TransactionErrorHandler that
overrules the default error handler. This is convention over
configuration.

== Features support by various Error Handlers

Here is a breakdown of which features are supported by the
Error Handler(s):

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Feature |Supported by the following Error Handler

|all scopes |DefaultErrorHandler,
TransactionErrorHandler,
Dead Letter Channel

Dead Letter Channel

|dead letter queue |Dead Letter Channel

|onPrepareFailure |DefaultErrorHandler,
Dead Letter Channel

|=======================================================================

See xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] documentation for
additional documentation of the features above.

== Scopes

The error handler is scoped as either:

- CamelContext - _Globally_ in XML or _globally only_ within the same `RouteBuilder` in Java DSL
- Route - _Individually per route_

The following example shows how you can register a global error handler for the `RouteBuilder`:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
        errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("seda:error"));

        // here is our regular route
        from("seda:a").to("seda:b");
    }
};
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following example shows how you can register a route specific error
handler

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
        // this route is using a nested error handler
        from("seda:a")
            // here we configure the error handler
            .errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("seda:error"))
            // and we continue with the routing here
            .to("seda:b");

        // this route will use the default error handler
        from("seda:b").to("seda:c");
    }
};
---------------------------------------------------------------

== Spring based configuration

*Java DSL vs. Spring DSL*
The error handler is configured a bit differently in Java DSL and Spring
DSL. Spring DSL relies more on standard Spring bean configuration
whereas Java DSL uses fluent builders.

The error handler can be configured as a spring bean and scoped in:

* global (the `<camelContext>` tag)
* per route (the `<route>` tag)
* or per policy (the `<policy>`/`<transacted>` tag)

The error handler is configured with the `errorHandlerRef` attribute.

TIP: *Error Handler Hierarchy* +
The error handlers are inherited, so if you only have set a global error
handler, then it is used everywhere. But you can override this in a route
and use another error handler.

=== Spring-based configuration sample

In this sample, we configure a xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter
Channel] on the route that should redeliver at most 3 times and use a
little delay before retrying. First we configure the reference to *myDeadLetterErrorHandler* using
the `errorHandlerRef` attribute on the `route` tag.

[source,xml]
----
    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
        <!-- set the errorHandlerRef to our DeadLetterChannel, this applies for this route only -->
        <route errorHandlerRef="myDeadLetterErrorHandler">
            <from uri="direct:in"/>
            <process ref="myFailureProcessor"/>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
----

Then we configure *myDeadLetterErrorHandler* that is our
Dead Letter Channel. This configuration
is standard Spring using the bean element.
And finally we have another spring bean for the redelivery policy where
we can configure the options for how many times to redeliver, delays
etc.

[source,xml]
----
    <!-- here we configure our DeadLetterChannel -->
    <bean id="myDeadLetterErrorHandler" class="org.apache.camel.builder.DeadLetterChannelBuilder">
	    <!-- exchanges is routed to mock:dead in cased redelivery failed -->
        <property name="deadLetterUri" value="mock:dead"/>
		<!-- reference the redelivery policy to use -->
        <property name="redeliveryPolicy" ref="myRedeliveryPolicyConfig"/>
    </bean>

    <!-- here we set the redelivery settings -->
    <bean id="myRedeliveryPolicyConfig" class="org.apache.camel.processor.errorhandler.RedeliveryPolicy">
	    <!-- try redelivery at most 3 times, after that the exchange is dead and its routed to the mock:dead endpoint -->
        <property name="maximumRedeliveries" value="3"/>
		<!-- delay 250ms before redelivery -->
        <property name="redeliveryDelay" value="250"/>
    </bean>
----

In *Camel 4.6* you can now inline `<errorHandler>` directly in the routes. The example above can be done as follows:

[source,xml]
----
    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
        <route>
            <errorHandler>
                <deadLetterChannel deadLetterUri="mock:dead">
                    <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="3" redeliveryDelay="250"/>
                </deadLetterChannel>
            </errorHandler>
            <from uri="direct:in"/>
            <process ref="myFailureProcessor"/>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
----


== Using the transactional error handler

The transactional error handler is based on spring transaction. This
requires the usage of the camel-spring or camel-jta component.

See xref:components:eips:transactional-client.adoc[Transactional Client] that has many
samples for how to use and transactional behavior and configuration with
this error handler.

= EventNotifier

The event notifier `org.apache.camel.spi.EventNotifier` is used to get notified about events within the CamelContext. For example, when a route is started or stopped.
The events are collected independently from the CamelContext (routes, services, exchanges, and so on). This means that the notifier doesn't interfere with the rest of Camel, and
the events can be processed independently for logging, data offloading or other type of actions.

== Type of Events

The following CamelEvents are available:

* CamelEvent
** CamelContextEvent
***	CamelContextInitializedEvent
***	CamelContextInitializingEvent
***	CamelContextReloadedEvent
***	CamelContextReloadFailureEvent
***	CamelContextReloadingEvent
***	CamelContextResumedEvent
***	CamelContextResumeFailureEvent
***	CamelContextResumingEvent
***	CamelContextRoutesStartedEvent
***	CamelContextRoutesStartingEvent
***	CamelContextRoutesStoppedEvent
***	CamelContextRoutesStoppingEvent
***	CamelContextStartedEvent
***	CamelContextStartingEvent
***	CamelContextStartupFailureEvent
***	CamelContextStopFailureEvent
***	CamelContextStoppedEvent
***	CamelContextStoppingEvent
***	CamelContextSuspendedEvent
***	CamelContextSuspendingEvent
** ExchangeEvent
***	ExchangeAsyncProcessingStartedEvent
***	ExchangeCompletedEvent
***	ExchangeCreatedEvent
***	ExchangeFailedEvent
***	ExchangeFailureEvent
***	ExchangeFailureHandledEvent
***	ExchangeFailureHandlingEvent
***	ExchangeRedeliveryEvent
***	ExchangeSendingEvent
***	ExchangeSentEvent
**	FailureEvent
**	RouteEvent
***	RouteAddedEvent
***	RouteReloadedEvent
***	RouteRemovedEvent
***	RouteStartedEvent
***	RouteStartingEvent
***	RouteStoppedEvent
***	RouteStoppingEvent
** ServiceEvent
***	ServiceStartupFailureEvent
***	ServiceStopFailureEvent
**	StepEvent
***	StepCompletedEvent
***	StepFailedEvent
***	StepStartedEvent

See the Javadoc of the `org.apache.camel.spi.CamelEvent` for more details.

== Collect Events

To collect events a class is needed that extends the EventNotifierSupport class.

[source,java]
----
public class MyCollector extends EventNotifierSupport {
    
    protected Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());

    @Override
    public void notify(CamelEvent event) throws Exception {

        log.info("Event: " event.getType().name());

    }

}
----

Then you can enable the notifier:

[source,java]
----
context.getManagementStrategy().addEventNotifier(new MyCollector());
----


== Collect Specific Events

By default you get notified by all events. It's however possible to exclude certain groups of events to get
only the group of event you are interest in.

In the following example we collect only StepEvents:

[source,java]
----
public class StepCollector extends EventNotifierSupport {
    protected Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());

    @Override
    public void notify(CamelEvent event) throws Exception {

        // Cast CamelEvent to StepEvent
        CamelEvent.StepEvent stepEvent = (CamelEvent.StepEvent) event;

        // Get detailed information from the StepEvent
        String eventType = stepEvent.getType().name();
        String stepId = stepEvent.getStepId();
        String body = stepEvent.getExchange().getMessage().getBody(String.class);

        log.info("Event Type:\t\t" + eventType);
        log.info("Step ID:\t\t\t" + stepId);
        log.info("Message Body:\t\t " + body);

    }

}
----

Then you can enable the notifier for steps by excluding other groups:

[source,java]
----
//Create eventNotifier that only collects stepEvents
StepCollector stepCollector = new StepCollector();
stepCollector.setIgnoreCamelContextEvents(true);
stepCollector.setIgnoreCamelContextInitEvents(true);
stepCollector.setIgnoreExchangeEvents(true);
stepCollector.setIgnoreRouteEvents(true);
stepCollector.setIgnoreServiceEvents(true);
stepCollector.setIgnoreStepEvents(false);

//Add the Event Notifier to the Camel Context
context.getManagementStrategy().addEventNotifier(stepCollector);
----

== Event Timestamps

By default, event timestamps are not included and the getTimestamp() method returns 0. 

Timestamps can be enabled from the CamelContext as follows:

[source,java]
----
context.getManagementStrategy().getEventFactory().setTimestampEnabled(true);
----
= Examples

looked at the xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns], you might want to try out some examples.

= Exception Clause

You can use the _Exception Clause_ in the Java xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] to
specify the error handling you require on a per exception type basis
using the *`onException()`* method. To get started we give quick sample
before digging into how it works.

For example if you want to perform a specific piece of processing if a
certain exception is raised you can do this simply via:

[source,java]
----
onException(ValidationException.class)
    .to("activemq:validationFailed");

from("seda:inputA")
    .to("validation:foo/bar.xsd", "activemq:someQueue");

from("seda:inputB")
    .to("direct:foo")
    .to("rnc:mySchema.rnc", "activemq:anotherQueue");
----

Here if the processing of *`seda:inputA`* or *`seda:inputB`* cause
a *`ValidationException`* to be thrown (such as due to the XSD
validation of the xref:components::validator-component.adoc[Validation] component),
then the message will be sent to the
*`activemq:validationFailed`* queue.

You can define multiple *`onException`* clauses for different behavior:

[source,java]
----
onException(ValidationException.class)
    .to("activemq:validationFailed");

onException(ShipOrderException.class)
    .to("activemq:shipFailed");

from("seda:order")
    .to("bean:processOrder");
----

== Scopes

Exception clauses is scoped as either:

* global (for Java DSL that is per *`RouteBuilder`* instances, to reuse,
see note below)
* or route specific

Where the *global* are the simplest and most easy to understand. In the
advanced section we dig into the route specific and even combining them.
However

Global scope for Java DSL is per *`RouteBuilder`* instance, so if you
want to share among multiple *`RouteBuilder`* classes, then create a
base abstract *`RouteBuilder`* class and put the error handling logic in
its *`configure`* method. And then extend this class, and make sure to
class *`super.configure()`*. We are just using the Java inheritance
technique.

== How Does Camel Select Which Clause Should Handle a Given Thrown Exception?

Camel uses *`DefaultExceptionPolicyStrategy`* to determine a strategy
how an exception being thrown should be handled by which *`onException`*
clause. The strategy is:

* the order in which the *`onException`* is configured takes precedence.
Camel will test from first...last defined.
* Camel will start from the bottom (nested caused by) and recursive up
in the exception hierarchy to find the first matching *`onException`*
clause.
* *`instanceof`* test is used for testing the given exception with the
*`onException`* clause defined exception list. An exact *`instanceof`*
match will always be used, otherwise the *`onException`* clause that has
an exception that is the closets super of the thrown exception is
selected (recurring up the exception hierarchy).

This is best illustrated with an exception:

[source,java]
----
onException(IOException.class)
    .maximumRedeliveries(3);

onException(OrderFailedException.class)
    .maximumRedeliveries(2);
----

In the sample above we have defined two exceptions in
which *`IOException`* is first, so Camel will pickup this exception if
there is a match. *`IOException`* that is more general is selected then.

So if an exception is thrown with this hierarchy:

....
+ RuntimeCamelException (wrapper exception by Camel)
    + OrderFailedException
        + IOException
            + FileNotFoundException
....

Then Camel will try testing the exception in this order:
*`FileNotFoundException`*, *`IOException`*, *`OrderFailedException`* and
*`RuntimeCamelException`*.
As we have defined a *`onException(IOException.class)`* Camel will
select this as it's the *closest* match.

If we add a third *`onException`* clause with the
*`FileNotFoundException`*

[source,java]
----
onException(IOException.class)
    .maximumRedeliveries(3);

onException(OrderFailedException.class)
    .maximumRedeliveries(2);

onException(FileNotFoundException.class)
    .handled(true)
    .to("log:nofile");
----

Then with the previous example Camel will now use the last
*`onException(FileNotFoundException.class)`* as its an *exact* match.
Since this is an exact match it will override the
general *`IOException`* that was used before to handle the same
exception thrown.

Now a new situation if this exception was thrown instead:

....
+ RuntimeCamelException (wrapper exception by Camel)
    + OrderFailedException
        + OrderNotFoundException
....

Then the *`onException(OrderFailedException.class)`* will be selected -
no surprise here.

And this last sample demonstrates the *`instanceof`* test aspect in
which Camel will select an exception if it's an instance of the defined
exception in the *`onException`* clause. Illustrated as:

....
+ RuntimeCamelException (wrapper exception by Camel)
    + SocketException
....

Since *`SocketException`* is an *`instanceof IOException`*, Camel will
select the *`onException(IOException.class)`* clause.

== Configuring RedeliveryPolicy (redeliver options)

https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-base/current/org/apache/camel/processor/errorhandler/RedeliveryPolicy.html[RedeliveryPolicy]
requires to use the xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel]
as the xref:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler]. Dead Letter Channel
supports attempting to redeliver the message exchange a number of times
before sending it to a dead letter endpoint. See
xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] for further
information about redeliver and which redeliver options exists.

=== No redelivery is default for onException

By default, any xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] will *not*
redeliver! (as it sets the `maximumRedeliveries` option to 0).

Sometimes you want to configure the redelivery policy on a per exception
type basis. By default in the top examples, if an
*`org.apache.camel.ValidationException`* occurs then the message will
not be redelivered; however if some other exception occurs, e.g.,
*`IOException`* or whatever, the route will be retried according to the
settings from the xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel].

However if you want to customize any methods on the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-base/current/org/apache/camel/processor/errorhandler/RedeliveryPolicy.html[RedeliveryPolicy]
object, you can do this via the fluent API. So lets retry in case
of *`org.apache.camel.ValidationException`* up till two times.

*Java DSL*:

[source,java]
----
onException(ValidationException.class)
    .maximumRedeliveries(2);
----

*XML DSL*:

[source,xml]
----
<onException>
    <exception>com.mycompany.ValidationException</exception>
    <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="2"/>
</onException>
----

You can customize any of the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-base/current/org/apache/camel/processor/errorhandler/RedeliveryPolicy.html[RedeliveryPolicy]
so we can for instance set a different delay of *`5000`* millis:

[source,xml]
----
<onException>
    <exception>com.mycompany.ValidationException</exception>
    <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="2" delay="5000"/>
</onException>
----

== Point of Entry for Redelivery Attempts

All redelivery attempts start at the point of the failure. So the route:

[source,java]
----
onException(ConnectException.class)
    .from("direct:start")
    .process("processor1")
    .process("processor2") // <--- throws a ConnectException
    .to("mock:theEnd")
----

Will retry from *`processor2`* - not the complete route.

== Reusing RedeliveryPolicy

You can reference a *`RedeliveryPolicy`* so you can reuse existing
configurations and use standard spring bean style configuration that
supports property placeholders.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myRedeliveryPolicy" class="org.apache.camel.processor.RedeliveryPolicy">
    <property name="maximumRedeliveries" value="${myprop.max}"/>
</bean>

<!-- here we reference our redelivery policy defined above -->
<onException redeliveryPolicyRef="myRedeliveryPolicy">
    <!-- you can define multiple exceptions just adding more exception elements as show below -->
    <exception>com.mycompany.MyFirstException</exception>
    <exception>com.mycompany.MySecondException</exception>
</onException>
----

== Asynchronous Delayed Redelivery

Camel has a feature to _not block_ while waiting for a
delayed redelivery to occur. However if you use transacted routes then
Camel will block as its mandated by the transaction manager to execute
all the work in the same thread context. You can enable the non blocking
asynchronous behavior by the *`asyncDelayedRedelivery`* option. This
option can be set on the *`errorHandler`*, *`onException`* or the
redelivery policies.

By default, the error handler will create and use a scheduled thread pool
to trigger redelivery in the future. You can also configure
the *`executorServiceRef`* on the xref:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler]
to indicate a reference to either a shared thread pool you can enlist in
the registry, or a thread pool profile in case you want to be able to
control pool settings.

== Catching Multiple Exceptions

Multiple exception can be caught as shown:

[source,java]
----
onException(MyBusinessException.class, MyOtherBusinessException.class)
    .maximumRedeliveries(2)
    .to("activemq:businessFailed");
----

And in XML DSL you just add another exception element:

[source,xml]
----
<onException>
    <exception>com.mycompany.MyBusinessException</exception>
    <exception>com.mycompany.MyOtherBusinessException</exception>
    <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="2"/>
    <to uri="activemq:businessFailed"/>
</onException>
----

== Using a Processor as a Failure Handler

We want to handle certain exceptions in a specific way, so we add
a *`onException`* clause for the particular exception.

[source,java]
----
// here we register exception cause for MyFunctionException
// when this exception occurs we want it to be processed by our
// processor
onException(MyFunctionalException.class)
  .process(new MyFunctionFailureHandler())
  .stop();
----


So what happens is that whenever a *`MyFunctionalException`* is thrown it
is being routed to our processor *`MyFunctionFailureHandler`*. So you
can say that the exchange is diverted when a *`MyFunctionalException`*
is thrown during processing. It's important to distinct this as perfectly
valid. The default redelivery policy from the
xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] will not kick in, so
our processor receives the Exchange directly, without any redeliver
attempted. In our processor we need to determine what to do. Camel
regards the Exchange as *failure handled*. So our processor is the end
of the route. So lets look the code for our processor.

[source,java]
----
    public static class MyFunctionFailureHandler implements Processor {

        @Override
        public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            // the caused by exception is stored in a property on the exchange
            Throwable caused = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.EXCEPTION_CAUGHT, Throwable.class);
            assertNotNull(caused);
            // here you can do what you want, but Camel regards this exception as
            // handled, and this processor as a failure handler, so it won't do redeliveries.
            // So this is the end of this route.
        }
    }
----

Notice how we get the *caused by* exception using a property on the Exchange.
This is where Camel stores any caught exception during processing. So
you can fetch this property and check what the exception message and do
what you want.

== Marking Exceptions as Handled

See also the section <<Handle and Continue Exceptions>> below.

Using *`onException`* to handle known exceptions is a very powerful
feature in Camel. You can mark the exception as being handled with the *handle* DSL,
so the caller will not receive the caused exception as a response. The handle is a
xref:predicate.adoc[Predicate] that is overloaded to accept three types
of parameters:

* Boolean
* xref:predicate.adoc[Predicate]
* xref:expression.adoc[Expression] that will be evaluated as a
xref:predicate.adoc[Predicate] using this rule set: If the expression
returns a Boolean, it is used directly. For any other response, it is regarded
as `true` if the response is `not null`.

For instance to mark all *`ValidationException`* as being handled we can
do this:

[source,java]
----
onException(ValidationException)
    .handled(true);
----

== Example Using Handled

In this route below we want to do special handling of
all *`OrderFailedException`* as we want to return a customized response
to the caller. First we setup our routing as:

[source,java]
----
    // we do special error handling for when OrderFailedException is
    // thrown
    onException(OrderFailedException.class)
        // we mark the exchange as handled so the caller doesn't
        // receive the
        // OrderFailedException but whatever we want to return
        // instead
        .handled(true)
        // this bean handles the error handling where we can
        // customize the error
        // response using java code
        .bean(OrderService.class, "orderFailed")
        // and since this is an unit test we use mocks for testing
        .to("mock:error");

    // this is just the generic error handler where we set the
    // destination
    // and the number of redeliveries we want to try
    errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error").maximumRedeliveries(1));

    // this is our route where we handle orders
    from("direct:start")
        // this bean is our order service
        .bean(OrderService.class, "handleOrder")
        // this is the destination if the order is OK
        .to("mock:result");
----

Then we have our service bean that is just a plain POJO demonstrating how you
can use xref:bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration] in Camel to avoid
being tied to the Camel API:

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Order service as a plain POJO class
     */
    public static class OrderService {

        /**
         * This method handle our order input and return the order
         */
        public Object handleOrder(@Headers Map headers, @Body String payload) throws OrderFailedException {
            headers.put("customerid", headers.get("customerid"));
            if ("Order: kaboom".equals(payload)) {
                throw new OrderFailedException("Cannot order: kaboom");
            } else {
                headers.put("orderid", "123");
                return "Order OK";
            }
        }

        /**
         * This method creates the response to the caller if the order could not
         * be processed
         */
        public Object orderFailed(@Headers Map headers, @Body String payload) {
            headers.put("customerid", headers.get("customerid"));
            headers.put("orderid", "failed");
            return "Order ERROR";
        }
    }
----

And finally the exception that is being thrown is just a regular exception:

[source,java]
----
    public static class OrderFailedException extends Exception {

        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

        public OrderFailedException(String message) {
            super(message);
        }

    }
----

So what happens?

If we sent an order that is being processed OK then the caller will
receive an Exchange as reply containing *`Order OK`* as the payload and
*`orderid=123`* in a header.

If the order could *not* be processed and thus
an *`OrderFailedException`* was thrown the caller will *not* receive
this exception but our customized response that we have
fabricated in the *`orderFailed`* method in our *`OrderService`*. So the
caller receives an Exchange with the payload *`Order ERROR`* and a
*`orderid=failed`* in a header.

== Using Handled with Spring XML DSL

The same route as above in Spring XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
 <!-- setup our error handler as the deal letter channel -->
<bean id="errorHandler" class="org.apache.camel.builder.DeadLetterChannelBuilder">
    <property name="deadLetterUri" value="mock:error"/>
</bean>

<!-- this is our POJO bean with our business logic defined as a plain spring bean -->
<bean id="orderService" class="org.apache.camel.spring.processor.onexception.OrderService" />

<!-- this is the camel context where we define the routes -->
<!-- define our error handler as a global error handler -->
<camelContext errorHandlerRef="errorHandler" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">

  <onException>
    <!-- the exception is full qualified names as plain strings -->
    <!-- there can be more just add a 2nd, 3rd exception element (unbounded) -->
    <exception>org.apache.camel.spring.processor.onexception.OrderFailedException</exception>
    <!-- we can set the redelivery policy here as well -->
    <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="1" />
    <!-- mark this as handled -->
    <handled>
      <constant>true</constant>
    </handled>
    <!-- let our order service handle this exception, call the orderFailed method -->
    <bean ref="orderService" method="orderFailed" />
    <!-- and since this is a unit test we use mock for assertions -->
    <to uri="mock:error" />
  </onException>

  <route>
    <!-- the route -->
    <from uri="direct:start" />
    <!-- in the normal route then route to our order service and call handleOrder method -->
    <bean ref="orderService" method="handleOrder" />
    <!-- and since this is a unit test we use mock for assertions -->
    <to uri="mock:result" />
  </route>

</camelContext>
----

== Handling and Sending a Fixed Response Back to the Client

In the route above we handled the exception but routed it to a different
endpoint. What if you need to alter the response and send a fixed
response back to the original caller (the client). No secret here just
do as you do in normal Camel routing, use
xref:components:eips:message-translator.adoc[transform] to set the response, as shown in
the sample below:

[source,java]
----
// we catch MyFunctionalException and want to mark it as handled
// (= no failure returned to client)
// but we want to return a fixed text response, so we transform
// OUT body as Sorry.
onException(MyFunctionalException.class)
  .handled(true)
  .transform().constant("Sorry");
----

We modify the sample slightly to return the original caused exception
message instead of the fixed text `Sorry`:

[source,java]
----
// we catch MyFunctionalException and want to mark it as handled
// (= no failure returned to client)
// but we want to return a fixed text response, so we transform
// OUT body and return the exception message
onException(MyFunctionalException.class)
  .handled(true)
  .transform(exceptionMessage());
----

And we can use the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language to set a readable error
message with the caused exception message:

[source,java]
----
// we catch MyFunctionalException and want to mark it as handled
// (= no failure returned to client)
// but we want to return a fixed text response, so we transform
// OUT body and return a nice message
// using the simple language where we want insert the exception
// message
onException(MyFunctionalException.class)
  .handled(true)
  .transform().simple("Error reported: ${exception.message} - cannot process this message.");
----

== Handle and Continue Exceptions

The option `continued` allows you to
both *`handle`* and *`continue`* routing in the original route as if the
exception did not occur.

For example: to ignore and continue when the *`IDontCareException`* was
thrown we can do this:

[source,java]
----
onException(IDontCareException.class)
    .continued(true);
----

You can maybe compare continued with a having a *`try ... catch`* block
around each step and then just ignore the exception. Using continued
makes it easier in Camel as you otherwise had to use
xref:try-catch-finally.adoc[Try Catch Finally] style for this kind of
use case.

=== Example Using continued

In this route below we want to do special handling of
all *`IllegalArgumentException`* as we just want to continue routing.

[source,java]
----
onException(IllegalArgumentException.class).continued(true);

from("direct:start")
  .to("mock:start")
  .throwException(new IllegalArgumentException("Forced"))
  .to("mock:result");
----

And the same example in Spring XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
 <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">

        <onException>
            <exception>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</exception>
            <!-- tell Camel to handle and continue when this exception was thrown -->
            <continued><constant>true</constant></continued>
        </onException>

        <route>
            <from uri="direct:start"/>
            <to uri="mock:start"/>
            <throwException message="Forced" exceptionType="java.lang.IllegalArgumentException"/>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </route>

    </camelContext>
----

== What is the Difference Between Handled and Continued?

If handled is true, then the thrown exception will be _handled_ and
Camel will *not* continue routing in the original route, but break out.
However you can configure a route in the *`onException`* which will be
used instead. You use this route if you need to create some custom
response message back to the caller, or do any other processing because
that exception was thrown.

If continued is true, then Camel will catch the exception and in fact
just ignore it and continue routing in the original route. However if
you have a route configured in the *`onException`* it will route that
route first, before it will continue routing in the original route.


== Using `useOriginalMessage`

The option *`useOriginalMessage`* is used for routing the original input
message instead of the current message that potential is modified during routing.

For example: if you have this route:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:order:input")
    .to("bean:validateOrder");
    .to("bean:transformOrder")
    .to("bean:handleOrder");
----

The route listen for JMS messages and validates, transforms and handle
it. During this the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] payload is
transformed/modified. So in case something goes wrong and we want to
move the message to another JMS destination, then we can add an
*`onException`*. But when we move the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] to
this destination we do not know in which state the message is in. Did
the error happen in before the *`transformOrder`* or after? So to be
sure we want to move the original input message we received from
`jms:queue:order:input`. So we can do this by enabling the
*`useOriginalMessage`* option as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// will use original input message (body and headers)
onException(MyOrderException.class)
    .useOriginalMessage()
    .handled(true)
    .to("jms:queue:order:failed");
----

Then the messages routed to the *`jms:queue:order:failed`* is the
original input. If we want to manually retry we can move the JMS message
from the failed to the input queue, with no problem as the message is
the same as the original we received.

== `useOriginalMessage` with Spring DSL

The *`useOriginalMessage`* option is defined as a boolean attribute on
the *`<onException>`* XML tag in Spring DSL. So the definition above
would be:

[source,xml]
----
<onException useOriginalMessage="true">
    <exception>com.mycompany.MyOrderException</exception>
    <handled><constant>true</constant></handled>
    <to uri="jms:queue:order:failed"/>
</onException>
----

== Boundary of original message

The original input means the input message that are bounded by the current unit of work. An unit of work typically spans one route, or multiple routes if they are connected 
using internal endpoints such as direct or seda. When messages are passed via external
endpoints such as JMS or HTTP then the consumer will create a new unit of work, with the
message it received as input as the original input. Also, some EIP patterns such as splitter,
multicast, will create a new unit of work boundary for the messages in their sub-route
(i.e. the split message); however these EIPs have an option named shareUnitOfWork which
allows combining with the parent unit of work in regard to error handling and therefore use
the parent original message.

== Using `useOriginalBody`

The useOriginalBody is similar to useOriginalMessage as documented above. You may want to use useOriginalBody when you want to be able to enrich the message with custom headers and preserve the original message body before sending to an error handler or dead letter channel.

For example: if you have this route:

[source,java]
----
// will use original input body
onException(MyOrderException.class)
    .useOriginalBody()
    .handled(true)
    .to("jms:queue:order:failed");

from("jms:queue:order:input")
    .setHeader("application", constant("OrderApp"))
    .to("bean:validateOrder");
    .to("bean:transformOrder")
    .to("bean:handleOrder");
----

Then the message has been enriched with a header named application after the original message was received by the JMS endpoint. And in case of an error `onException`
will handle the exception and use the original message body and the headers from the current message as-is, which means the headers will include the application header.

== Advanced Usage of Exception Clause

Camel supports advanced configuration of exception clauses.

=== Using Global and Per Route Exception Clauses

You can define exception clauses either as:

* global
* or route specific

We start off with the sample that we change over time. First off
we use only global exception clauses:

[source,java]
----
// default should errors go to mock:error
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error").redeliveryDelay(0));

// if a MyTechnicalException is thrown we will not try to
// redeliver and we mark it as handled
// so the caller does not get a failure
// since we have no to then the exchange will continue to be
// routed to the normal error handler
// destination that is mock:error as defined above
onException(MyTechnicalException.class).maximumRedeliveries(0).handled(true);

// if a MyFunctionalException is thrown we do not want Camel to
// redelivery but handle it our self using
// our bean myOwnHandler, then the exchange is not routed to the
// default error (mock:error)
onException(MyFunctionalException.class).maximumRedeliveries(0).handled(true).to("bean:myOwnHandler");

// here we route message to our service bean
from("direct:start").choice().when().xpath("//type = 'myType'").to("bean:myServiceBean").end().to("mock:result");
----

In the next sample we change the global exception policies to be pure route
specific.

=== Must use `.end()` for route specific exception policies

[IMPORTANT] This requires to end the *`onException`* route with
*`.end()`* to indicate where it stops and when the regular route
continues.

[source,java]
----
// default should errors go to mock:error
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error"));

// here we start the routing with the consumer
from("direct:start")

    // if a MyTechnicalException is thrown we will not try to
    // redeliver and we mark it as handled
    // so the caller does not get a failure
    // since we have no to then the exchange will continue to be
    // routed to the normal error handler
    // destination that is mock:error as defined above
    // we MUST use .end() to indicate that this sub block is
    // ended
    .onException(MyTechnicalException.class).maximumRedeliveries(0).handled(true).end()

    // if a MyFunctionalException is thrown we do not want Camel
    // to redelivery but handle it our self using
    // our bean myOwnHandler, then the exchange is not routed to
    // the default error (mock:error)
    // we MUST use .end() to indicate that this sub block is
    // ended
    .onException(MyFunctionalException.class).maximumRedeliveries(0).handled(true).to("bean:myOwnHandler").end()

    // here we have the regular routing
    .choice().when().xpath("//type = 'myType'").to("bean:myServiceBean").end().to("mock:result");
----

And now it gets complex as we combine global and route specific exception
policies as we introduce a second route in the sample:

[source,java]
----
// global error handler
// as its based on a unit test we do not have any delays between
// and do not log the stack trace
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error").redeliveryDelay(0).logStackTrace(false));

// shared for both routes
onException(MyTechnicalException.class).handled(true).maximumRedeliveries(2).to("mock:tech.error");

from("direct:start")
    // route specific on exception for MyFunctionalException
    // we MUST use .end() to indicate that this sub block is
    // ended
    .onException(MyFunctionalException.class).maximumRedeliveries(0).end().to("bean:myServiceBean").to("mock:result");

from("direct:start2")
    // route specific on exception for MyFunctionalException
    // that is different than the previous route
    // here we marked it as handled and send it to a different
    // destination mock:handled
    // we MUST use .end() to indicate that this sub block is
    // ended
    .onException(MyFunctionalException.class).handled(true).maximumRedeliveries(0).to("mock:handled").end().to("bean:myServiceBean").to("mock:result");
----

Notice that we can define the same exception *`MyFunctionalException`* in both
routes, but they are configured differently and thus is handled
different depending on the route. You can of course also add a
new *`onException`* to one of the routes so it has an additional
exception policy.

And finally we top this by throwing in a nested error handler as well,
as we add the 3rd route shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start3")
    // route specific error handler that is different than the
    // global error handler
    // here we do not redeliver and send errors to mock:error3
    // instead of the global endpoint
    .errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error3").maximumRedeliveries(0))

    // route specific on exception to mark MyFunctionalException
    // as being handled
    .onException(MyFunctionalException.class).handled(true).end()
    // however we want the IO exceptions to redeliver at most 3
    // times
    .onException(IOException.class).maximumRedeliveries(3).end().to("bean:myServiceBean").to("mock:result");
----

=== Global exception policies and nested error handlers

The sample above with both nested error handlers and both global and per
route exception clauses is a bit advanced. It's important to get the
fact straight that the *global* exception clauses is really global so
they also applies for nested error handlers. So if a
*`MyTechnicalException`* is thrown then it's the global exception policy
that is selected.

== Using Fine Grained Selection Using `onWhen` Predicate

You can attach an xref:expression.adoc[Expression] to the exception
clause to have fine grained control when a clause should be selected or
not. As it's an xref:expression.adoc[Expression] you can use any kind of
code to perform the test. Here is a sample:

[source,java]
----
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error").redeliveryDelay(0).maximumRedeliveries(3));

// here we define our onException to catch MyUserException when
// there is a header[user] on the exchange that is not null
onException(MyUserException.class).onWhen(header("user").isNotNull()).maximumRedeliveries(1)
    // setting delay to zero is just to make unit testing faster
    .redeliveryDelay(0).to(ERROR_USER_QUEUE);

// here we define onException to catch MyUserException as a kind
// of fallback when the above did not match.
// Notice: The order how we have defined these onException is
// important as Camel will resolve in the same order as they
// have been defined
onException(MyUserException.class).maximumRedeliveries(2)
    // setting delay to zero is just to make unit testing faster
    .redeliveryDelay(0).to(ERROR_QUEUE);
----

In the sample above we have two *`onException`*'s defined. The first has
an *`onWhen`* expression attached to only trigger if the message has a
header with the key user that is not null. If so this clause is selected
and is handling the thrown exception. The second clause is a for coarse
gained selection to select the same exception being thrown but when the
expression is evaluated to false.

[NOTE]
====
This is not required, if the second clause is omitted, then the
default error handler will kick in.
====

== Using onRedelivery Processor

xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] has support
for *`onRedelivery`* to allow custom processing of a Message before its
being redelivered. It can be used to add some customer header or
whatnot. In Camel 2.0 we have added this feature to
xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] as well, so you can use per
exception scoped on redelivery. Camel will fallback to use the one
defined on xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] if any, if
none exists on the xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause]. See
xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] for more details on
*`onRedelivery`*.

In the code below we want to do some custom code before redelivering any
*`IOException`*. So we configure an *`onException`* for
the *`IOException`* and set the *`onRedelivery`* to use our custom
processor:

[source,java]
----
// when we redeliver caused by an IOException we want to do some
// special code before the redeliver attempt
onException(IOException.class)
    // try to redeliver at most 3 times
    .maximumRedeliveries(3)
    // setting delay to zero is just to make unit testing faster
    .redeliveryDelay(0).onRedelivery(new MyIORedeliverProcessor());
----

And in our custom processor we set a special timeout header to the message.
You can of course do anything what you like in your code.

[source,java]
----
// This is our processor that is executed before every redelivery attempt
// here we can do what we want in the java code, such as altering the
// message
public static class MyRedeliverProcessor implements Processor {

    @Override
    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
        // the message is being redelivered so we can alter it

        // we just append the redelivery counter to the body
        // you can of course do all kind of stuff instead
        String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        int count = exchange.getIn().getHeader("CamelRedeliveryCounter", Integer.class);

        exchange.getIn().setBody(body + count);
    }
}
----

== Using onRedelivery in Spring XML DSL

In Spring DSL you need to use the *`onRedeliveryRef`* attribute to refer
to a spring bean id that is your custom processor:

[source,xml]
----
<onException onRedeliveryRef="myIORedeliverProcessor">
    <exception>java.io.IOException</exception>
</onException>
----

And our processor is just a regular spring bean (we use *`$`* for the inner
class as this code is based on unit testing):

[source,xml]
----
 <bean id="myRedeliveryProcessor"
          class="org.apache.camel.processor.DeadLetterChannelOnExceptionOnRedeliveryTest$MyRedeliverProcessor"/>
----

== Using onExceptionOccurred Processor

xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] has support
for *`onExceptionOccurred`* to allow custom processing of a Message just
after the exception was thrown. It can be used to do some custom logging
or whatnot. The difference between *`onRedelivery`* processor
and *`onExceptionOccurred`* processor, is that the former is processed
just before a redelivery attempt is being performed, that means it will
not happen right after an exception was thrown. For example if the error
handler has been configured to perform 5 seconds delay between
redelivery attempts, then the redelivery processor is invoked 5 seconds
after the exception was thrown. On the other hand
the *`onExceptionOccurred`* processor is always invoked right after the
exception was thrown, and also if redelivery has been disabled.

[NOTE]
====
Any new exceptions thrown from the *`onExceptionOccurred`*
processor is logged as *`WARN`* and ignored, to not override the
existing exception. 
====

In the code below we want to do some custom logging when an exception
happened. Therefore we configure an *`onExceptionOccurred`* to use our
custom processor:

[source.java]
----
errorHandler(defaultErrorHandler()
    .maximumRedeliveries(3)
    .redeliveryDelay(5000)
    .onExceptionOccurred(myProcessor));
----

=== Using onRedelivery in Spring XML DSL

In Spring DSL you need to use the *`onExceptionOccurredRef`* attribute
to refer to a spring bean id that is your custom processor:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myProcessor" class="com.foo.MyExceptionLoggingProcessor"/>

<camelContext errorHandlerRef="eh" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <errorHandler id="eh" type="DefaultErrorHandler" onExceptionOccurredRef="myProcessor">
        <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="3" redeliveryDelay="5000"/>
    </errorHandler>
    ...
</camelContext>
----

== Using Fine Grained Retry Using retryWhile Predicate

When you need fine grained control for determining if an exchange should
be retried or not you can use the *`retryWhile`* predicate. Camel will
redeliver until the predicate returns false.

Example:

[source,java]
----
// we want to use a predicate for retries so we can determine in
// our bean when retry should stop, notice it will overrule the global
// error handler where we defined at most 1 redelivery attempt. Here we will
// continue until the predicate returns false
onException(MyFunctionalException.class).retryWhile(method("myRetryHandler")).handled(true).transform().constant("Sorry");
----

Where the bean *`myRetryHandler`* is computing if we should retry or not:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRetryBean {

    // using bean binding we can bind the information from the exchange to
    // the types we have in our method signature
    public boolean retry(@Header(Exchange.REDELIVERY_COUNTER) Integer counter) {
        // NOTE: counter is the redelivery attempt, will start from 1
        // we can of course do what ever we want to determine the result but
        // this is a unit test so we end after 3 attempts
        return counter < 3;
    }
}
----

== Using Custom ExceptionPolicyStrategy

The default
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-core-processor/current/org/apache/camel/processor/errorhandler/ExceptionPolicyStrategy.html[ExceptionPolicyStrategy]
in Camel should be sufficient in nearly all use-cases.
However, if you need to use your own (use only for rare and advanced use-cases) this can be configured as the
sample below illustrates:

[source,java]
----
// configure the error handler to use my policy instead of the default from Camel
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error").exceptionPolicyStrategy(new MyPolicy()));
----

Using our own strategy *`MyPolicy`* we can change the default behavior of
Camel with our own code to resolve which exception type
from above should be handling the given thrown exception.

[source,java]
----
public static class MyPolicy implements ExceptionPolicyStrategy {

    @Override
    public ExceptionPolicyKey getExceptionPolicy(Set<ExceptionPolicyKey> exceptionPolicies, Exchange exchange, Throwable exception) {
        // This is just an example that always forces the exception type configured
        // with MyPolicyException to win.
        return new ExceptionPolicyKey(null, MyPolicyException.class, null);
    }
}
----

== Using the Exception Clause in Spring XML DSL

You can use all of the above mentioned exception clause features in the
Spring XML DSL as well. Here are a few examples:

* Global scoped

[source,xml]
----
<!-- setup our error handler as the deal letter channel -->
<bean id="errorHandler" class="org.apache.camel.builder.DeadLetterChannelBuilder">
    <property name="deadLetterUri" value="mock:error"/>
</bean>

<!-- this is our POJO bean with our business logic defined as a plain spring bean -->
<bean id="orderService" class="org.apache.camel.spring.processor.onexception.OrderService" />

<!-- this is the camel context where we define the routes -->
<!-- define our error handler as a global error handler -->
<camelContext errorHandlerRef="errorHandler" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">

  <onException>
    <!-- the exception is full qualified names as plain strings -->
    <!-- there can be more just add a 2nd, 3rd exception element (unbounded) -->
    <exception>org.apache.camel.spring.processor.onexception.OrderFailedException</exception>
    <!-- we can set the redelivery policy here as well -->
    <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="1" />
    <!-- mark this as handled -->
    <handled>
      <constant>true</constant>
    </handled>
    <!-- let our order service handle this exception, call the orderFailed method -->
    <bean ref="orderService" method="orderFailed" />
    <!-- and since this is a unit test we use mock for assertions -->
    <to uri="mock:error" />
  </onException>

  <route>
    <!-- the route -->
    <from uri="direct:start" />
    <!-- in the normal route then route to our order service and call handleOrder method -->
    <bean ref="orderService" method="handleOrder" />
    <!-- and since this is a unit test we use mock for assertions -->
    <to uri="mock:result" />
  </route>

</camelContext>

<!-- setup our error handler as the deal letter channel -->
<bean id="deadLetter" class="org.apache.camel.builder.DeadLetterChannelBuilder">
    <property name="deadLetterUri" value="mock:dead"/>
</bean>

<!-- the default error handler used in the 2nd route -->
<bean id="defaultErrorHandler" class="org.apache.camel.builder.DefaultErrorHandlerBuilder"/>

<!-- this is our POJO bean with our business logic defined as a plain spring bean -->

<!-- this is the camel context where we define the routes -->

        <onException>
            <exception>org.apache.camel.spring.processor.onexception.OrderFailedException</exception>
            <redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="1"/>
            <handled>

    </route>

    <!-- The exception clause specified in the first route will not be used in this route -->
    <route errorHandlerRef="defaultErrorHandler">
        <from uri="direct:start_with_no_handler"/>
        <bean ref="orderService" method="handleOrder"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

</camelContext>
----

= Exchange Pattern

There are two _Message Exchange Patterns_ you can use in
messaging.

From there xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] they are:

* xref:components:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Message] (or one-way)
* xref:components:eips:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request Reply]

In Camel we have an
`org.apache.camel.ExchangePattern`
enumeration which can be configured on the *exchangePattern* property on
the Message Exchange indicating if a message
exchange is a one way xref:components:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Message] (*InOnly*) or
a xref:components:eips:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request Reply] message exchange (*InOut*).

For example to override the default pattern on a xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS]
endpoint you could use the `exchangePattern` parameter in the Endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URI]
as shown:

[source,text]
----
jms:myQueue?exchangePattern=InOut
----
= Exchange Pooling

The routing engine keeps the state of each message, tracking the message flow, and where the messages are going next. The routing engine also handles complex tasks such as error handling, capturing metrics, and many other things. A small number of Java objects are allocated on the heap for each processing step during routing.

Because of this routing bookkeeping and processing, Apache Camel requires a tiny resource overhead when routing messages.

With the advance of cloud computing, where workloads are precisely measured, then Camel has undergone a series of core optimizations to reduce its overhead.

== Pooling objects to reduce object allocations

The most significant object being reused is the `org.apache.camel.Exchange` object. This object is the root object
that holds the message with its payload, headers, metadata, and other content.

Besides pooling exchanges, the internal objects used by the routing engine are also pooled and recycled. This can dramatically reduce the object allocations from Camel core itself.

There will always be object allocations from the actual message content (payload and headers), and also from the Camel components in use and its 3rd party libraries. The footprint of Camel core and its routing engine is close to zero when pooling is enabled.

This all sounds marvelous so what are the negative aspects? The price to pay for object pooling is the complexity of managing the pool (acquiring and returning objects to the pool). However, all of this is taken care of by Camel itself. The object pools are using JDK `ConcurrentMap` instances and take up very little memory. Managing the pool causes a small CPU overhead associated with adding and removing objects from the pools, and resetting the objects before reuse.

In most cases, it may be possible to sacrifice the very tiny CPU cost in exchange for reduced object allocations. This can improve responsiveness and reduce latency by preventing the JVM garbage collection from running more frequently (under some circumstances, the garbage collection overhead can cause your application to halt or delay processing messages due to stop-the-world pauses and other processing overhead associated with it).

== Enabling Exchange Pooling

The _object pooling_ is currently disabled by default. If you are using Camel Main (from Camel Core), Camel Spring Boot, or Camel Quarkus, then you can enable this in the `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.exchange-factory = pooled
----

=== Enabling Exchange Pooling on Camel 3.x

If you are using a different runtime or want to do that programmatically, you can do so in Camel version 3 (Camel 3.x) using the `setExchangeFactory` method from the `ExtendedCamelContext`. Here's an example of how to do that using Java:

[source,java]
----
// suppose a Camel context object declared in the scope
CamelContext context = ...

context.adapt(ExtendedCamelContext.class).setExchangeFactory(new PooledExchangeFactory());
----

[NOTE]
====
The `ExtendedCamelContext` is an internal API of Camel and, as such, may not offer the same level of backward compatibility as the public APIs. Whenever possible, configure the exchange pooling via application properties.
====

=== Enabling Exchange Pooling on Camel 4.x

If you are using a different runtime or if you want to do that programmatically, you can do so in Camel 4 and newer versions using the `setExchangeFactory` method from the `ExtendedCamelContext`. Here's an example of how to do that using Java:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.getExchangeExtension().setExchangeFactory(new PooledExchangeFactory());
----

[NOTE]
====
The `ExtendedCamelContext` is an internal API of Camel and, as such, may not offer the same level of backward compatibility as the public APIs. Whenever possible, configure the exchange pooling via application properties.
====

== Configuration Options

You can configure exchange pooling with the following options:

[width="100%",cols="25%,50%,25%",options="header"]
|===
|Option |Description | Default
| exchange-factory | Whether to use pooling or not. Possible values are prototype or pooled | prototype
| exchange-factory-capacity | Maximum number of elements in the pool | 100
| exchange-factory-statistics-enabled | Whether to capture usage statistics | false
|===

== Management

If object pooling is enabled, then Camel provides a JMX MBean which allows us to introspect the pools and their usage via JMX. This requires adding `camel-management` JAR to the classpath.

== Examples

We have provided a few examples which we are using for performance profiling.
You can check the basic https://github.com/apache/camel-performance-tests/tree/main/profiling/timer-log[timer-log] if you need an example.


= Message Exchange

A request message and its corresponding reply or exception message is represented in Camel using the `Exchange` interface.
This interface provides an abstraction for this pattern of communication between systems.
The presence of a reply message is optional and depends on the xref:exchange-pattern.adoc[exchange pattern] used in the integration.
Thanks to this, Apache Camel can support different integration patterns such as:

* xref:components:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Messages]: messages that have only an inbound message
* xref:components:eips:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request and Reply]: messages that have an inbound and an outbound message.

== Learn More About Exchanges

* xref:manual::exchange-pooling.adoc[Exchange Pooling]
* xref:manual::using-exchange-pattern-annotations.adoc[Using Exchange Pattern Annotations]

== Implementation Details

There are concrete classes that implement the `Exchange` interface for each Camel-supported communications technology. For example, the `JmsExchange` class provides a JMS-specific implementation of the `Exchange` interface. The public API of the `Exchange` interface is limited intentionally: we expect that each class that implements this interface will provide its own technology-specific operations.

Application-level programmers rarely access the `Exchange` interface (or classes that implement it) directly. However, many classes in Camel are generic types that are instantiated on (a class that implements) `Exchange`. Because of this, the `Exchange` interface appears a lot in the generic signatures of classes and methods.
= Expressions

Expressions and xref:predicate.adoc[Predicates] can then be used to
create the various xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] in the xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] like with the xref:components:eips:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List] EIP.

To support dynamic rules Camel supports pluggable
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Expression.html[Expression]
strategies using a variety of different xref:components:languages:index.adoc[Languages].

== Expression API

If you are outside the DSL and want to create your own
expressions you can either implement the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Expression.html[Expression
interface], reuse one of the other builders or try the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-support/current/org/apache/camel/support/builder/ExpressionBuilder.html[ExpressionBuilder
class].

=== Expression

The API for a Camel Expression is defined in the
`org.apache.camel.Expression` interface as shown:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public interface Expression {

    /**
     * Returns the value of the expression on the given exchange
     *
     * @param exchange the message exchange on which to evaluate the expression
     * @param type the expected type of the evaluation result
     * @return the value of the expression
     */
    <T> T evaluate(Exchange exchange, Class<T> type);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= Getting Started

You can get started with Apache Camel in a variety of ways, such as:

- Using online Project generators
- Using the Camel CLI (command line)
- Using Camel Karavan (visual UI Camel designer)

And some more alternative methods:

- Adding Camel to an existing project
- Using IDE tooling wizards
- Using Maven Archetypes
- Cloning an existing example to modify


== Using online Project generators

You can use https://kameleon.dev/#/standalone[Camel Kameleon] which is Camel's own
online project generator. This generator is Camel focused only, which is recommended
for most Camel users.

You can also use https://start.spring.io/[Spring Boot Initializer] which is the Spring Boot
generator that also has Camel support. However, this generator does not allow users to have fine-grained control over which components, data formats, kamelets etc. they can use.

And there is https://code.quarkus.io/[Code with Quarkus], the Quarkus
generator, which has great support with Camel.


== Getting Started from command line (CLI)

Camel uses https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] for the Camel CLI.
You can easily get up and running in a few steps.

*Step 1*

Open your favorite terminal and use JBang to install the Camel CLI.
You do not need to have Java installed first.

For Linux, macOS, and Windows (using WSL or bash compatible shell like Cygwin or MinGW)

[source,bash]
----
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - trust add https://github.com/apache/
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app install --fresh --force camel@apache/camel
----

For Windows using Powershell

[source,shell script]
----
iex "& { $(iwr https://ps.jbang.dev) } trust add https://github.com/apache/"
iex "& { $(iwr https://ps.jbang.dev) } app install --fresh --force camel@apache/camel"
----

If it's your first time to install, you'll need to restart your shell.

*Step 2*

Create your first Camel integration

[source,bash]
----
camel init hello.java
----

*Step 3*

Run the Camel integration

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java
----

Bang the Camel integration is now running.
You can use `ctrl` + `c` to stop the integration.

*Step 4*

Camel makes it easy to change your code on the fly.
You can run in live coding mode, as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --dev
----

While in live coding mode, whenever you save changes to `hello.java`, Camel will automatically load the updated version.

*Step 5*

Make sure to check out the xref:camel-jbang.adoc[Camel JBang] documentation, for more details on the powers
of the Camel CLI. You will also find information how you can _export_ what you have built
with the Camel CLI into a vanilla Camel Spring Boot or Camel Quarkus project.

== Getting started with Camel using Karavan

The https://github.com/apache/camel-karavan[Camel Karavan] is a toolkit for visually
designing Camel integrations, it is fully integrated with xref:camel-jbang.adoc[Camel JBang]
which allows users to easily try Camel while using the designer.

== Alternative ways of getting started with Camel

=== Adding Camel to an existing project

You can add Camel to any Java project, such as adding the necessary Camel dependencies
to the project build files (Maven or Gradle).

=== Using IDE tooling wizards

Some IDEs have wizards for creating new projects, of which, some have support for
Apache Camel via Spring Boot Initializer or Code with Quarkus.

=== Using Maven Archetypes

Apache Camel comes with a set of xref:camel-maven-archetypes.adoc[Camel Maven Archetypes],
you can use to create a new Camel project.

=== Cloning an existing example to modify

There are tons of Camel examples hosted on Github that you can clone and modify,
such as https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples[Camel Spring Boot examples].

= Graceful Shutdown

Camel supports a pluggable shutdown strategy using
`org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy`. Its responsible for shutting
down routes in a graceful manner. The other resources will still be
handled by xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] to shutdown. This leaves
the problem at hand with properly shutting down all the routes reliably
to the `ShutdownStrategy`.

Camel provides a default strategy in the
`org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultShutdownStrategy` which is capable of
doing that.

== Default Shutdown Strategy

The default strategy (`DefaultShutdownStrategy`) will gracefully shutdown routes:

* in the reverse order they were started
* let pending and current in flight exchanges run to completion before
shutting down
* using a timeout of 45 seconds which then forces a _hard_ shutdown

The settings are configurable, so you can change the timeout, and
whether in case of timeout to force a _hard_ shutdown or ignore.

When shutting down the strategy will output to log the progress:

[source,log]
---------------------------------
2009-12-20 10:56:53,055 [main ] INFO DefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel (CamelContext:camel-1) is stopping
2009-12-20 10:56:53,056 [main ] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Starting to graceful shutdown routes (timeout 45 seconds)
2009-12-20 10:56:53,059 [1: ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Waiting as there are still 5 inflight exchanges to complete before we can shutdown
2009-12-20 10:56:54,060 [1: ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Waiting as there are still 4 inflight exchanges to complete before we can shutdown
2009-12-20 10:56:55,061 [1: ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Waiting as there are still 3 inflight exchanges to complete before we can shutdown
2009-12-20 10:56:56,065 [1: ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Waiting as there are still 2 inflight exchanges to complete before we can shutdown
2009-12-20 10:56:57,066 [1: ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Waiting as there are still 1 inflight exchanges to complete before we can shutdown
2009-12-20 10:56:58,069 [main ] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Graceful shutdown of routes complete in 5 seconds.
2009-12-20 10:56:58,072 [main ] INFO DefaultInflightRepository - Shutting down with no inflight exchanges.
2009-12-20 10:56:58,077 [main ] INFO DefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel (CamelContext:camel-1) stopped
---------------------------------

Notice how the strategy waits while there are inflight exchanges still being
processed before it shutdown the routes and after that Camel itself.

=== Suppressing logging due to timeout not allowing all inflight messages to complete

If a graceful shutdown could not shutdown cleanly within the given
timeout period, then Camel performs a more aggressive shutdown (hard) by
forcing routes and thread pools etc to shut down, and the routing
engine will reject continue processing xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange]s. If
this happens you may see WARN logs about xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange]s
being rejected and other failures due the forced shutdown.

If you do not want to see these logs, you can suppress this by setting
the option suppressLoggingOnTimeout to true.

[source,java]
---------------------------------
context.getShutdownStrategy().setSuppressLoggingOnTimeout(true);
---------------------------------

Notice that suppression is _a best effort_ attempt and there may still be some
logging from 3rd party libraries, which Camel cannot control.

=== Logging inflight exchange information on timeout

If a graceful shutdown could not shutdown cleanly within the given
timeout period, then Camel performs a more aggressive shutdown by
forcing routes and thread pools etc to shut down. When the timeout
happens, then Camel logs information about the current inflight
exchanges, which shows from which route the exchange origins, and where
it currently is being routed. For example the logging below, shows that
there is 1 inflight exchange, that origins from route1, and currently is
still in route1 at the "delay1" node. The elapsed is time in millis how
long at the current node (eg delay1) and duration is total time in
mills.

If you enable DEBUG logging level
on `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultShutdownStrategy` then it logs the same
inflight exchange information during graceful shutdown

[source,log]
---------------------------------
2015-01-12 13:23:23,656 [ - ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy -
There are 1 inflight exchanges: InflightExchange:
[exchangeId=ID-davsclaus-air-62213-1421065401253-0-3,
fromRouteId=route1, routeId=route1, nodeId=delay1, elapsed=2007,
duration=2017]
---------------------------------

If you do not want to see these logs, you can turn this off by setting
the option logInflightExchangesOnTimeout to false.

[source,java]
---------------------------------
context.getShutdownStrategy().setLogInflightExchangesOnTimeout(false);
---------------------------------

=== JMX managed

The `ShutdownStrategy` is JMX aware, so you can manage it from a
JMX console. This allows to adjust the strategy at runtime.

TIP: The timeout settings can also be changed on the `CamelContextMBean`.

== Controlling ordering of routes

You can configure the order in which routes should be started, and thus
also the same order they are being shutdown.
 See more at
xref:configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.adoc[Configuring
route startup ordering and autostartup].

== Fine grained configuration

You can control two areas that influence graceful shutdown in the Camel
routing:

* `ShutdownRoute`
* `ShutdownRunningTask`

These options can be configured on two levels: _context_ and _route_.
The route level take precedence over context, meaning that if not
explicit configured on the route level, then the context level is used.

=== ShutdownRoute

This option can control how a given route should act during graceful
shutdown. It has two values `Default` and `Defer`. The `Default` is
obviously the default option which lets Camel shutdown the route as
early as possible. The `Defer` is used to defer shutting down this route
to a later stage. This is useful when other routes are dependent upon
it. For example an internal route which other routes reuse.

NOTE: It is best to only defer shutting down internal routes only. Public
routes should shut down as quickly as possible otherwise it will just
keep intake new messages which will delay the shutdown processor. Or
even have it timeout if a lot of new messages keep coming in.

=== ShutdownRunningTask

This option control how a given route consumer acts during shutdown.
Most route consumer will only operate on a single task (message),
however the xref:batch-consumer.adoc[Batch Consumer] can operate on many
messages (in a batch). This option is for batch consumers.

The default value is `CompleteCurrentTaskOnly` which mean that the
current _in progress_ task (message) will be completed and then the
consumer will shut down. The other option `CompleteAllTasks` allows the
consumer to complete all the tasks (messages) before shutting down. For
example a xref:components::file-component.adoc[File] consumer will process all the pending
files it has picked up before shutting down.

== Stop individual routes

It is possible to stop (will do a gracefully shut down) an individual route using
`stopRoute(routeId)` method as shown:

[source,java]
----
camelContext.getRouteController().stopRoute(routeId);
----

Routes can also be stopped via JMX.

=== Stopping and marking routes as failed due to an exception

It is possible to stop and fail (will do a gracefully shut down) an individual route using
`stopRoute(routeId, cause)` method as shown:

[source,java]
----
Exception cause = ...
camelContext.getRouteController().stopRoute(routeId, cause);
----

This will stop the route and then mark the route as failed with the caused exception.

NOTE: The Camel xref:health-check.adoc[Health Check] detect the route as failed and report it as DOWN.
If the route is manually stopped, then the route is not marked as failed,
and the xref:health-check.adoc[Health Check] will report the status as UNKNOWN.

Routes can also be stopped and failed via JMX.

== Implementing custom component or ShutdownStrategy

If you develop your own Camel component or want to implement your own
shutdown strategy then read this section for details.

=== ShutdownStrategy

You can implement your own strategy to control the shutdown by
implementing the `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy` and the set it
on the `CamelContext` using the `setShutdownStrategy` method.

=== ShutdownAware

The interface `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownAware` is an optional
interface consumers can implement to have fine grained control during
shutdown. The `ShutdownStrategy` must be able to deal with consumers
which implement this interface. This interface was introduced to cater
for in memory consumers such as xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] which potentially
have a number of pending messages on its internal in memory queues. What
this allows is to let it control the shutdown process to let it complete
its pending messages.

The method `getPendingExchangesSize` should return the number of pending
messages which reside on the in memory queues.
The method `deferShutdown` should return `true` to defer the shutdown
to a later stage, when there are no more pending and inflight messages.

xref:batch-consumer.adoc[Batch Consumer] should implement
`ShutdownAware` so they properly support the `ShutdownRunningTask`
option. See `GenericFileConsumer` for an example.


= Health Checks

Camel provides support to probe the state of an integration via a pluggable Health Check strategy based on the following concepts:

- *HealthCheck:* represents a health check and defines its basic contract.
- *HealthCheckResponse:* represents a health check invocation response.
- *HealthCheckConfiguration:* a basic configuration object that holds some basic settings like the minimum delay between calls, the number of times a service may be reported as unhealthy before marking the check as failed; besides these simple options, the check implementation is responsible for implementing further limitations where needed.
- *HealthCheckRegistry:* a registry for health checks. There is a single default implementation and end users should really not implement their own.
- *HealthCheckRepository:* a simple interface to define health check providers. By default there is one that grabs all the checks available in the registry so you can add your own check i.e. instantiating your bean in spring/spring-boot; components can provide their own repository.

== Health checks out of the box

Camel provides the following health checks out of the box:

- _context_ - A `HealthCheck` which performs check whether the `CamelContext` is started. This can be used for readiness checks; to know when Camel is fully started and ready to handle traffic.
- _routes_ - A `HealthCheckRegistry` which discovers all the available routes in `CamelContext` and checks whether they are all started.
This can be used for readiness checks; to know when Camel is fully started and ready to handle traffic.
Combining with the supervised `RouteController` this allows to perform readiness check for routes that are under supervising,
such as troublesome routes that may not start up the first time, and are retried to be started in the background with backoff delays.
- _consumers_ A `HealthCheckRegistry` which discovers all the consumers from all the routes in `CamelContext`
enabling fine-grained checks for the route input. This means if the consumer is failing to poll new messages
then the health check can detect this and report as un-healthy. Note that the consumer will be DOWN during its initialization and until at least
one poll run has been executed, to know whether that poll was a success or not. And if the poll was a success
then the consumer is UP. This is on purpose to avoid having the health check to be initially UP
and then after first poll run then DOWN again because the consumer cannot poll from external system;
which causes the health check to be _flaky_.
- _producers_ A `HealthCheckRegistry` which are for producer based health-checks. There are a few components
which comes with producer health checks such as `camel-kafka` and many of the `AWS` components.
However, producer health checks are by default disabled. See further below for how to enable producer health checks.
- _registry_ - A `HealthCheckRegistry` which discovers all the available custom `HealthCheck` instances in the `Registry`.

== IDs

A `HealthCheck` and `HealthCheckRegistry` has an ID. The ID has the name syntax `*name*-health-check`, or `*name*-health-check-repository`.
With the suffix `-health-check` or `-health-check-repository`. When looking up or resolving by IDs then the shorthand name can be used.

For example `context-health-check` is the ID but can also be used by its shorthand `context`.

The ID of the consumer health checks is the route id with `consumer:` as prefix, i.e. if the route
is named foo, then the ID is `consumer:foo`.

== Readiness and Liveness

Readiness and Liveness probes serve distinct purposes. Readiness indicates whether the application is ready to serve requests or traffic.
Liveness probes indicates whether the application is alive and functioning. A health check is by default usable for both readiness and liveness checks.

To check wether a health check is usable for readiness or livesness:

[source,java]
----
HealthCheck healthCheck = HealthCheckHelper.getHealthCheck(camelContext, healthCheckId);

System.out.println("Readiness=" + healthCheck.isReadiness());
System.out.println("Live=" + healthCheck.isLiveness());
----

To specify a custom health check as only usable for liveness checks,
you would need to turn off readiness, by overriding the `isReadiness` method and return `false`.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public boolean isReadiness() {
    return false;
}
----

== Configuring health-check

Camel supports via `camel-main` to configure health-checks from configuration files. This is possible for runtimes that leverage `camel-main`
such as Camel on Spring Boot, or Camel K.

Camel will automatically enable `context`, `routes`, `consumers`, `producers` and `registry` health-checks if `camel-health` is detected on the classpath.
They are all enabled by default (except for `producers` which is disabled).

However, you can configure them, for example to turn them off:

[source,properties]
----
# global option to turn health-check off (will not install health-check)
### camel.health.enabled=false

# allows to enable or disable health-checks from startup
# for example to only use context health-check
camel.health.routesEnabled=false
camel.health.consumersEnabled=false
camel.health.registryEnabled=false
----

The same can also be done programmatically using the Camel health api:

[source,java]
----
HealthCheckRepository consumersHealthCheckRepository = HealthCheckHelper.getHealthCheckRepository(context, "consumers");

if (consumersHealthCheckRepository != null) {
    consumersHealthCheckRepository.setEnabled(false);
}
----

=== How to consume the health check

Once you have the health check exposed as a service and the application is up and running, you can check it by accessing the related endpoint:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/q/health
{
    "status": "UP"
,
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "context",
            "status": "UP"        },
        {
            "name": "route:route1",
            "status": "UP"        },
        {
            "name": "consumer:route1",
            "status": "UP"        }
    ]
}
```

NOTE: the path can change depending on the runtime used and the configuration.

When you're running on certain runtimes you will get more information by default. This is also possible in the `camel-main` runtime provider. However, you'll need to specify that as a request parameter:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/q/health?data=true
{
    "status": "UP"
,
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "context",
            "status": "UP",
            "data": {
                 "check.group": "camel",
                 "check.id": "context",
                 "check.kind": "ALL",
                 "context.name": "camel-1",
                 "context.phase": "5",
                 "context.status": "Started",
                 "context.version": "4.12.0-SNAPSHOT",
                 "failure.count": "0",
                 "invocation.count": "2",
                 "invocation.time": "2025-03-20T09:43:01.870896479+01:00[Europe/Madrid]",
                 "success.count": "2",
                 "success.start.time": "2025-03-20T09:42:59.074646004+01:00[Europe/Madrid]",
                 "success.time": "2025-03-20T09:43:01.870896479+01:00[Europe/Madrid]"
            }
        },
...
```

=== Configuring initial state

The initial state of health-checks (readiness). There are the following states: UP, DOWN, UNKNOWN.

By default, the state is DOWN, is regarded as being pessimistic/careful. This means that the overall health
checks may report as DOWN during startup and then only if everything is up and running flip to being UP.

Setting the initial state to UP, is regarded as being optimistic. This means that the overall health checks may
report as UP during startup and then if a consumer or other service is in fact un-healthy, then the health-checks
can flip being DOWN.

Setting the state to UNKNOWN means that some health-check would be reported in unknown state, especially during
early bootstrap where a consumer may not be fully initialized or validated a connection to a remote system.

This option allows to pre-configure the state for different modes.

=== Excluding health-checks

By default, all enabled health-checks are invoked by Camel when check the health status.

It is possible to specify checks that should be excluded, for example a specific route by the route-id.

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exclude-pattern = myroute
----

You can specify multiple patterns (and use wildcards) such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exclude-pattern = myroute,foo,bar*
----

==== Routes that are not automatically started

If a route is configured to not to automatically start (`autoStartup=false`),
then the route and its corresponding consumer health checks is always up as it is externally managed.

=== Turning off consumer level health-checks

If routes health check is enabled then they will execute consumer health-checks as well
as part of an aggregated response.

The consumer checks can be turned off, to only use the route level checks (status of the route)

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.consumersEnabled=false
----

You can also turn off individual consumers by prefixing the ID with `consumer:` and the route id:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exclude-pattern = consumer:myroute*
----

which will turn off checks for all consumers on routes that starts with `myroute` in the route ID.

Or you can turn off producer based health checks by their component name:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exclude-pattern = producer:kafka*
----

Or all AWS producer health-checks

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exclude-pattern = producer:aws*
----

=== Turning on producer level health-checks

Only consumer based health-checks is enabled by default.

Some components (in particular AWS) provides also health checks for producers.
These health checks can be enabled via:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.producersEnabled=true
----

=== Turning off health checks from components

Some Camel components comes with health-checks.

For example to turn off both consumer and producer health checks from Kafka:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.kafka.health-check-consumer-enabled = false
camel.component.kafka.health-check-producer-enabled = false
----

TIP: You can turn of either consumer, producer or both.

== JMX management

The health check is manageable via JMX (requires `camel-management` JAR on the classpath).
You can find the `DefaultHealthCheck` MBean under the `health` node in the Camel JMX tree.

This MBean allows at runtime to manage health-checks where you can enable and disable checks based on their IDs.
As well have the latest status whether the overall health check is healthy or not.
The MBean also allows invoking health checks based on IDs (or all of them).

=== Configuring level of details in the health check responses

The option `exposureLevel` sets the level of details to exposure as result of invoking health checks.

There are the following levels:

- _full_ - The full level will include all details and status from all the invoked health checks.
- _default_ - The default level will report UP if everything is okay, and only include detailed information for health check that was DOWN.
- _oneline_ - The oneline level will only report either UP or DOWN.

You can specify multiple patterns (and use wildcards) such as:

For example to only report either as UP or DOWN then use:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exposure-level = oneline
----

=== Enriching and controlling health check responses

Each health check that is invoked will gather details about the result using `HealthCheckResultBuilder`.

To allow enriching and manipulating the result, then you can use `HealthCheckResultStrategy` to
plug in a custom bean that can process the result, and change state, add information, remove unwanted information,
etc. on the result builder.

The custom bean should be registered to the Camel xref:registry.adoc[Registry] to be discovered
by `camel-health`. Only one instance of the bean is allowed.

== Invoking health checks

You can invoke the health checks from Java by using the `org.apache.camel.health.HealthCheckHelper` which has APIs
to easily invoke all the health checks and gather their results, or filter out unwanted checks, or invoke only
the readiness or liveness checks.

The health checks can also be invoked from JMX.

== Writing a custom health check

There are a limited number of health checks provided by Camel out of the box,
so you may need to write your own check which you can do by implementing the _HealthCheck_ interface
or by extending _AbstractHealthCheck_ which provides some useful methods.

To make the health-check discoverable you should annotate the class with `@HealthCheck` and
the _name_-check syntax.

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.spi.annotations.HealthCheck;
import org.apache.camel.impl.health.AbstractHealthCheck;

@HealthCheck("my-check")
public final class MyHealthCheck extends AbstractHealthCheck {

    public MyHealthCheck() {
        super("myapp", "my-check");
    }

    @Override
    protected void doCall(HealthCheckResultBuilder builder, Map<String, Object> options) {
        // Default value
        builder.unknown();

        // Add some details to the check result
        builder.detail("my.detail", camelContext.getName());

        if (unhealtyCondition) {
            builder.down();
        } else {
            builder.up();
        }
    }
}
----

You can now make _MyHealthCheck_ available to Camel by adding an instance to (for example Spring application context)
or directly to the Camel xref:registry.adoc[Registry].

== Loading custom health checks

Camel can discover and load custom health checks from classpath scanning. This requires
to annotate the custom health checks with `@HealthCheck` annotation on the class (see above).

Then the xref:camel-component-maven-plugin.adoc[camel-component-maven-plugin] can be
used to automatic generated service loader file in `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/health-checks` that Camel uses
to discover the custom health checks.

You must also enable loading custom health check by setting (Camel Main, Camel K, or Camel Quarkus):

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.load-health-checks = true
----

And in Spring Boot:

[source,properties]
----
camel.springboot.load-health-checks = true
----

And if you use the classic Spring XML, you can enable this on `<camelContext>` as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext loadHealthChecks="true">
    ...
</camelContext>
----

And of course you can also enable loading health checks from Java via `CamelContext`:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.setLoadHealthChecks(true);
----

TIP: The example `main-health` has a custom health check which is loadable.

=== Loading custom health checks in Camel Quarkus

If you use Camel Quarkus then you can write custom health checks with
xref:components:others:microprofile-health.adoc[MicroProfile Health], which
Camel Quarkus can automatically discover during build time compilation and ensure
are automatically loaded.

Using Camel's own health check APIs does however allow building health checks
that are usable anywhere you use Camel whether its standalone, spring boot, quarkus,
or something else.

== Writing custom Health Check for Camel components

You can implement custom health checks in Camel components (currently only for consumers).

To do this, you implement the interface `HealthCheckAware` on your consumer class, which should
return the custom health check in the getter method.

In the custom health check implementation, you can perform the check as shown in the previous section.
Camel will then use these custom component health checks when it performs *routes* health checks.

== Examples

There are examples for Camel at:

- Camel Standalone: https://github.com/apache/camel-examples/tree/main/main-health[main-health]
- Camel Spring Boot: https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples/tree/main/health-checks[health-checks]
- Camel Quarkus: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus-examples/tree/main/health[health]
= HTTP Session Handling

Several Camel components can use HTTP as the underlying transport protocol.
In general HTTP calls are stateless in nature, however some servers allow
maintaining state via cookies. Cookies are often used to maintain a server
session (e.g. via a session cookie called "JSESSIONID" with servers implementing
the JEE Servlet specification).

== Session Scope

If a Camel route intends to implement some kind of HTTP session handling
the scope of this session should be considered.

Independently of the session scope the implementation must honor the domain of
the handled cookies.

=== Route/Context Scope

It might be desirable to have a single session for a route or a
CamelContext. This essentially means that all calls to
a server issued from a route or CamelContext share a single HTTP session.

=== Endpoint Scope

It is also possible to have a session on an
Endpoint entity. This would mean that all invocations of
an HTTP call issued by a single Endpoint share a session, whereas different
Endpoints never share sessions, even if the call is sent to the same server.

=== Exchange Scope

The third option to define a session scope is on
Exchange level. This is particularly useful for scenarios
where the server session is really maintaining state.

In this case the route could e.g. first do a login call, then some update calls
and finally a logout call. If the session handling would be defined on route or
CamelContext scopes this would seem to run, however under load parallel invocations
of the route would share a *single* session, which could cause issues. If the session
is defined on exchange scope, each invocation of the route will get a separate session,
and the server can maintain a separate state for the different parallel invocations.

== Usage

If you are a Camel user, you see that several Camel components support the cookieHandler
parameter on endpoint level. All you need to do is to instantiate a cookie handler
appropriate for your use case and reference it in the cookieHandler parameter for
all endpoints that are supposed to participate in the HTTP session.

There are two pre-implemented cookie handlers:

- `org.apache.camel.http.common.cookie.InstanceCookieHandler`
- `org.apache.camel.http.common.cookie.ExchangeCookieHandler`

The `InstanceCookieHandler` stores  cookies in an instance of itself. You can compare that
to a browser instance that is shared between all the endpoints that use it (and will
be used for all invocations of these endpoints). If you want to maintain separate sessions
for different endpoints or groups of endpoints you may have multiple instances of the
`InstanceCookieHandler`.

The `ExchangeCookieHandler` stores the session in the exchange. With the browser analogy
this means that each Exchange will get its own browser instance (so sessions are separated).
As the `ExchangeCookieHandler` does not store any state it is generally not useful to have
multiple `ExchangeCookieHandler` instances (as they would access the same data, anyway).

== Example

The following three routes will each do two invocations of an echo REST service. In the first
route (without a cookie handler) each invocation will get a new session. For the second route
all invocations will share a session. For the third route the first, and the second invocation
within the route share a session, but different (even parallel) invocations of the route will
not share a session.

  <bean id="exchangeCookieHandler" class="org.apache.camel.http.common.cookie.ExchangeCookieHandler"/>
-----------------------------------------------------------

Both `CookieHandler` implementations support setting a CookiePolicy to control the policy for storing
cookies. Default is `CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ORIGINAL_SERVER`.

== Cookies and EIPs

Some EIPs like xref:components:eips:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] or xref:components:eips:split-eip.adoc[Split]
create multiple exchanges from a single one. If no `org.apache.camel.http.common.cookie.ExchangeCookieHandler`
is used before this, each multicast or splitter branch will have its own cookie store. This will not be the case
if the first invocation of one of the endpoints using the cookie handler is before the multicast, because in
this case the cookie store will be attached to the original exchange, and the exchanges created by the multicast
will copy the reference to this cookie store so there is effectively a shared cookie store across branches.
As a workaround, you can call a `cookieHandler.getCookieStore()` e.g. by setting this to some dummy header.

== Component Developers

If you want to develop a HTTP based component that is supposed to participate in a session
you have to add the following parts to your code:

. Include a build reference to camel-http-common (if it is not already there)
. Add a cookieHandler parameter to the endpoint class (together with getter and setter)
. Before your code does the HTTP call, if a cookie handler is set on the endpoint
perform a `cookieHandler.loadCookies(exchange, uri)` call. It will return a
`Map<String, List<String>>` containing the headers that need to be sent to the server.
The details how you need to send these headers to the server depend on the underlying HTTP
API you are using.
. After your code does receive the HTTP response if a cookie handler is set on the endpoint
perform a `cookieHandler.storeCookies(exchange, uri, m)` call. `m` is a
`Map<String, List<String>>` containing the HTTP headers returned from the server.

NOTE: Some APIs provide more direct support for cookie handling. In this case it might be easier
to get the underlying `java.net.CookieStore` with a `cookeManager.getCookieStore(exchange)` call
and handle the cookies using the cookie interface provided by the underlying library.= Improving the documentation

The Apache Camel project loves your help with improving the documentation, whether its
a tiny typo fix, or adding more details to an existing component, etc.

NOTE: This page only describes working with the 'documentation' portion of the website.
Other portions are written in markdown and built using Hugo.

== Simple changes

If there's an `edit this page` button at the top right of the page and you wish to propose a simple change such as fixing a typo or rewording something, use this xref:faq:how-do-i-edit-the-website.adoc[very simple process].
For more complicated changes, including changing xrefs, adding, removing or renaming pages, and significant organizational changes, please use the process described on this page.

== Where to find the documentation

All of the documentation accessible in the left-hand navigation panel in the documentation portion of the website is managed in the link:https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc format] and built with the https://antora.org[Antora] static site generator.
As of November 2021, by far the most capable Asciidoc editor is the Intellij Asciidoc plugin, which works with  all Intellij editor products including the free IDEA Community Edition.
The plugin preview is more capable than viewing a local Asciidoc file with a browser plugin as it has some understanding of Antora structure.
Note that the only reliable way to preview your changes is with a full build of the Antora portion of the website.

The files have the extension `.adoc` and are managed in the Camel repositories.
General documentation is usually directly editable.
Component specific documentation is partially or entirely generated from other metadata sources which are in turn generated from the code, often from javadoc.
Altering generated documentation requires finding the original source, which varies by project.
Editable pages are found in several different places in the repositories:

Main camel repository::
Camel components::: In the `src/main/docs` folder for the component or camel module.
These are symlinked to under `docs/components`.
EIPs::: In the `core/camel-core-engine/src/main/docs` folder.
Core languages::: In the `core/camel-core-languages/src/main/docs` folder.
Note that many languages are under `components`.
User manual and FAQS::: In the `/docs/user-manual` folder.
Camel Karaf:: In the `docs` folder.
Camel Spring Boot:: Most documentation is generated and appended to the component documentation it applies to.
Editable pages are under `docs/spring-boot` and `core/camel-spring-boot/src/main/docs` and `core/camel-spring-boot-xml/src/main/docs`.

Other subprojects::
camel-k, camel-k-runtime::: Under `docs`.
There is no generated `camel-k` documentation.
camel-kafka-connector::: Editable pages are under `docs`.
Most documentation is generated directly from the generated json files for each connector under `connectors/<connector-name>/src/generated/resources`.
camel-kamelets::: Only `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc` is editable.
All other documentation is generated from the kamelet yaml descriptors.
camel-quarkus::: Editable pages are under `docs`.
Pages under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/reference/components` and `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/reference/extensions` are generated, including optional snippets from e.g. `extensions/activemq/src/main/doc`.
camel-quarkus-examples::: Editable pages are under `docs`.

[#_local_build_instructions]
== How to build the website locally, with your changes

First, make sure you have yarn, version >= 3.1.0, installed globally.

All three builds rely on a 'site-manifest' that lists the contents of the site with enough detail so that Antora knows about all the pages.

NOTE: The following procedure is not available in all subprojects yet.
If there is no `docs/local-build.sh` in the one you are working on, please ping djencks on zulip and I'll try to get it in soon.

=== Directory layout and initial setup

You need a single directory, such as `camel`, that contains all the camel subprojects you are working with, and the `camel-website` project.

[source,console]
----
cd camel
git clone https://github.com/apache/camel-website.git
----

=== Quick partial build

In your project, run
[source,sh]
----
./local-build.sh quick
----

This will build your local subproject substituted into the main Camel website build.
It will check syntax in your local subproject, and xrefs within it and from it to the rest of the site.
It will not check xrefs into your subproject.

Under `camel-website/documentation` you will find only the pages for your subproject.
Looking at this in a browser, links within the subproject will stay in the local pages, and links to the rest of the site will go to the main camel site.
There is no obvious way to get back to your local pages.

=== Full local Antora build

You only have to do this once, and again whenever there are significant changes to the website.

In your project, run
[source,sh]
----
./local-build.sh full
----
This will build the entire site, including your changes in your branch, and generate a 'site-manifest' listing all the contents of the website, that can be used to build only small parts of the site.
This full build will also check that all xrefs into your subproject branch are valid.

=== Subsequent partial continuous builds

After this full build completes, you can work on documentation with live updates in your browser by running
[source,sh]
----
./local-build.sh
----
This will do an initial build of just the current branch in the current subproject, incorporating it into the full site built in the full build, start a web server to serve the site, set up browser-sync on pages you are looking at in your browser, and rebuild the (partial) site as it detects changes.
Depending on the amount of content generation Antora is doing, this may take up to a minute or so.

This partial build will detect broken xrefs within your branch and from your branch to the main site, but will not (yet) detect broken xrefs from the rest of the site into your branch.
If you rename or remove a page please do a full build or check the PR build carefully for broken xrefs.

=== Viewing a full build in httpd

If you do a full build (`yarn build-all` or `yarn build` rather than `yarn build:antora` or use of the `local-build.sh` script in a subproject) and have Docker available locally you can view your build served with httpd by running `local-httpd-in-docker.sh`.
This is especially valuable to check redirects set up with `page-aliases`.

== Creating a documentation pull request.

NOTE: Simple changes such as typo fixes or rewording can usually be done directly at GitHub after pressing the `edit this page` button at the top left of each page.
Note that if the page source starts with a comment that the page is copied or generated this will not work!
Please do not use this method if you are changing any xrefs or making significant changes to format; instead follow the procedure below.

. Fork/clone the appropriate repository from GitHub and switch to the branch you are working with.
. Create a branch for your work with a name starting with the original branch name, e.g. `git switch -c main-doc-fix`
. Edit the `.adoc` sources as needed.
Preview your work in the Intellij Asciidoc plugin preview or in a browser with an Asciidoctor extension installed.
. Do a xref:#_local_build_instructions[local website build with your changes].
//=== The following workflow may be usable after https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/831 is implemented, perhaps with the aid of an Antora extension.
//. Commit and push your work and create a PR in the (sub)project repository.
//Note the PR number, e.g. #456
//. Fork/clone the camel-website repository, and create an appropriate branch, e.g. `git switch -c camel-quarkus-main-456`.
//. Locate the project you are working with in the `antora-playbook.yml` under `sources`, and locate the branch you have altered under the appropriate `-url`.
//Leaving the original branch as a comment, alter the branch to e.g. `- pull/456` using the PR number you noted earlier.
//. Commit the change to the playbook, push it to your `camel-website` fork, and open a PR against `camel-website`.
//CI will build your change and, if successful, will deploy a preview on Netlify.
//There will be an email with the preview URL.
//. Check for build problems and examine the preview.
//. Upon approval, your content PR will be merged.
//Unless you have made a considerably more extensive change than described above, the `camel-website` PR will not need to be merged and may be closed.
//
//=== Currently usable workflow
. Commit and push your work and create a PR in the (sub)project repository.
. Fork/clone the camel-website repository, and create an appropriate branch, e.g. `git switch -c camel-quarkus-main-456`.
The following process will work for any number of doc PRs against any number of source repositories: usually you will have one subproject repo and one branch.
. Locate the `- url` of the project(s) you are working with in the `antora-playbook.yml` under `sources`, and locate the branch(es) you have altered under that `- url`.
. Add something like this to the end of the  `antora-playbook.yml`:
+
--
[source,yml]
----
    - require: '@djencks/antora-source-map'
#      log_level: trace #<1>
      source-map: <2>
        - url: 'https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets.git' # <3>
          mapped-url: 'https://github.com/djencks/camel-kamelets.git' # <4>
          branches: # <5>
            - branch: main # <6>
              mapped-branch: main-collect # <7>
            - branch: 0.6.x
              mapped-branch: 0.6.x-collect
            - branch: 0.5.x
              mapped-branch: 0.5.x-collect
----
<1> Turning on trace logging will show you in great detail what's changed from the regular playbook, which can be useful if the build is not doing what you expect.
<2> List of source urls to substitute, probably only one.
<3> The GitHub URL of the subproject you are working on.
<4> The GitHub URL of your fork of the subproject.
<5> List of modified branches: probably only one.
<6> Name of the branch your PR will merge into.
<7> Name of your PR branch.
--
. At this point you can test your playbook changes locally by running `yarn build:antora` or `yarn build`.
. Commit the playbook changes, push to your fork of the `camel-website` repository, and open a PR.
. If all goes well you will get an email telling you where the Netlify preview is; this is also shown on the PR page.
. Check for build problems and examine the preview.
. Upon approval, your content PR will be merged.
A `camel-website` PR constructed as described here will not need to be merged and may be closed.

== New, renamed, or removed pages

* Add, rename, or remove the xref for your page in the appropriate nav.adoc file.
* Build the entire website and check for broken xrefs: these will appear as errors in the Antora log output.

== Changed xrefs

First, read xref:#_a_guide_to_xrefs[]

* Build the entire website and check for broken xrefs.

== Adding a new component version

See xref:release-guide-website.adoc[].

== A guide to xrefs

For a general explanation of Antora xref syntax see https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/page/xref/[the Antora documentation].
Due to the logical structure of the Camel documentation, xrefs will have a very limited choice of structure.

IMPORTANT: A bit of confusion is possible here between Antora components and Camel components.
Generally an Antora component corresponds more or less to a Camel subproject, and never to a camel commponent.
All the camel components are documented in an Antora component named `components`.
In this section the word `component` means an Antora component.

IMPORTANT: Antora components may be `distributed` which means that the content comes from more than one place, possibly from different repositories.
For instance, the `components` component has content from the main camel repository under the start_paths `docs/components` and `core/camel-core-engine/src/main/docs` and from the `camel-spring-boot` repository under `components-starter` and `docs/components`.
Furthermore the content may not appear in the normal Antora structure but may be collected from a more maven-project-friendly arrangement with an Antora extension.

=== xrefs within an (Antora) component

Generally there will never be a reason to refer from one version of a component to another version.
To assure this happens without maintenance issues, leave out the version and component segments from the xref, e.g. in the `components` component

[source,adoc,subs=+attributes]
xref{blank}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[]

NOT

[source,adoc,subs=+attributes]
xref{blank}:next@components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[]

Do this no matter how many locations the component is distributed over.

An xref within the same module can leave out the module segment, although it does no harm.

Do not specify the component name: if you do, the link will be to the `latest` (non-prerelease, i.e., non-`next`) version, not the current version.

=== Links to the user manual

The user-manual component is https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/component-with-no-version/[unversioned].
Leave out the version segment.
For example, this will link to this page from anywhere in the documentation:

[source,adoc]
xref:manual::improving-the-documentation.adoc[]

=== Links between subprojects

Each camel subproject relates to other subprojects, and each version of a subproject relates to specific versions of these other subprojects.
These subproject versions are specified in the `antora.yml` component descriptor for the documentation component for that subproject.
Note that for distributed components each start path has a component descriptor but only one has the additional `asciidoc/attributes` key.
For example,

[source,yaml]
----
name: camel-kafka-connector
title: Camel Kafka Connector
version: next
prerelease: true
display-version: Next (Pre-release)

nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc

asciidoc:
  attributes:
    camel-version: 3.12.x
    camel-k-runtime-version: 1.8.0
    camel-k-version:
    camel-kamelets-version: 0.3.0
----

NOTE: Setting these up is WIP

Use these attributes to refer to documentation for the related subproject, e.g.

[source,adoc]
xref{blank}:{camel-version}@components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[]

If there's a missing attribute, please raise an issue rather than using a concrete version.= Apache Camel user manual

Apache Camel™ is a versatile open-source integration framework based on
known xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

Camel empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of
domain-specific languages (xref:manual::dsl.adoc[DSL], such as Java, XML, Groovy, and YAML).
This means you get smart completion of
routing rules in your IDE, whether in a Java or XML editor.

For a deeper and better understanding of Apache Camel, an xref:faq:what-is-camel.adoc[Introduction] is provided.

= Injector

The
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/spi/Injector.html[Injector]
is a pluggable strategy to any IoC container such as
Spring to be able to create and
dependency-inject objects of a certain type.

= Java DSL

Apache Camel offers a Java-based DSL.

In the Java DSL you create a route by extending the xref:manual::route-builder.adoc[`RouteBuilder` class], and implementing the `configure` method.

== Java DSL example

This is best illustrated by an example.
In the code below we create a new class called `MyRouteBuilder` that extends the
`org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder` from Camel.

In the `configure` method the Java DSL is at our disposal.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

/**
 * A Camel Java DSL Router
 */
public class MyRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

    /**
     * Let's configure the Camel routing rules using Java code...
     */
    public void configure() {

        // here is a sample which processes the input files
        // (leaving them in place - see the 'noop' flag)
        // then performs content based routing on the message using XPath
        from("file:src/data?noop=true")
            .choice()
                .when(xpath("/person/city = 'London'"))
                    .to("file:target/messages/uk")
                .otherwise()
                    .to("file:target/messages/others");
    }

}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the `configure` method we can define Camel xref:routes.adoc[Routes].

In the example above we have a single route, which pickup files (the `from`).

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
from("file:src/data?noop=true")
---------------------------------------

Then we use the xref:components:eips:choice-eip.adoc[Content-Based Router] EIP
(the `choice`) to route the message whether the person is from London or not.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
.choice()
    .when(xpath("/person/city = 'London'"))
        .to("file:target/messages/uk")
    .otherwise()
        .to("file:target/messages/others");
-------------------------------------------------------

=== Using Text Blocks for long URIs

If you have very long endpoint xref:uris.adoc[uris], then you can declare those in Java text blocks, instead
of breaking a String into multiple added elements:

[source,java]
----
    from("""
            debezium-postgres:customerEvents
            ?databasePassword={{myPassword}}
            &databaseDbname=myDB
            &databaseHostname=myHost
            &pollIntervalMs=2000
            &queryFetchSize=100
        """)
        .to("kafka:cheese");
----

=== Routes using Java lambda style

Camel now supports to define Camel routes in Java DSL using Lambda style. This can be beneficial for microservices or serverless where
you may want to quickly define a few routes.

For example, using lambda style you can define a Camel route that takes messages from Kafka and send to JMS in a single line of code:

[source,java]
----
rb -> rb.from("kafka:cheese").to("jms:queue:foo");
----

There is a bit more to this as the lambda route must be coded in a Java method that returns an instance of `LambdaRouteBuilder`.
See more at the xref:lambda-route-builder.adoc[LambdaRouteBuilder] documentation.


== More Details

For more details see xref:dsl.adoc[DSL], xref:routes.adoc[Routes], and xref:processor.adoc[Processor].

=== The Java DSL under the hood

As mentioned in the Getting Started guide, you can use Camel's Java DSL in a way that almost looks like a DSL. For instance:

*Note*: comments afterward explain some of the constructs used in the example.

.*Example of Camel's "Java DSL"*
[source,java]
----
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
        from("queue:a").filter(header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")).to("queue:b");

        from("queue:c").choice()
                .when(header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")).to("queue:d")
                .when(header("foo").isEqualTo("cheese")).to("queue:e")
                .otherwise().to("queue:f");
    }
};
CamelContext myCamelContext = new DefaultCamelContext();
myCamelContext.addRoutes(builder);
----

The first line in the above example creates an object which is an instance of an anonymous subclass of `RouteBuilder` with the specified `configure()` method.

The `CamelContext.addRoutes(RouterBuilder builder)` method invokes `builder.setContext(this)` – so the `RouteBuilder` object knows which `CamelContext` object it is associated with – and then invokes `builder.configure()`. The body of `configure()` invokes methods such as `from()`, `filter()`, `choice()`, `when()`, `isEqualTo()`, `otherwise()` and `to()`.

The `RouteBuilder.from(String uri)` method invokes `getEndpoint(uri)` on the `CamelContext` associated with the `RouteBuilder` object to get the specified `Endpoint` and then puts a `FromBuilder` _wrapper_ around this `Endpoint`. The `FromBuilder.filter(Predicate predicate)` method creates a `FilterProcessor` object for the `Predicate` (that is, condition) object built from the `header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")` expression. In this way, these operations incrementally build up a `Route` object (with a `RouteBuilder` wrapper around it) and add it to the `CamelContext` instance associated with the `RouteBuilder`.


== More Information

See xref:lambda-route-builder.adoc[Lambda Route Builder] for creating a routing rule using the DSL, using Java lambda style.
= JMX

Camel has optional support for JMX management, which is
part of the `camel-management` and `camel-management-api` JARs.

== Using JMX to manage Apache Camel

The JMX instrumentation agent is enabled in Camel when the `camel-management`
JAR is included in the classpath. Once enabled, the Camel runtime creates and
registers MBean management objects with a `MBeanServer` instance in the VM.
This allows Camel users to instantly obtain insights into how Camel routes
perform down to the individual processor level.

The high level supported types of management objects are:

- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedCamelContext.html[CamelContext]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedComponent.html[Component]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedConsumer.html[Consumer]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedDataFormat.html[DataFormat]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedEndpoint.html[Endpoint]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedProcessor.html[Processor]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedRoute.html[Route]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedService.html[Service]

Most of these management objects also expose lifecycle operations in
addition to performance counter-attributes.


== Disabling or enabling Camel JMX

JMX is only enabled in Camel when the `camel-management` JAR is included on the
classpath. To quickly enable or disable JMX, simply add or remove this JAR
from the classpath.

It is also possible to enable or disable JMX via configuration as documented below.

You can disable the JMX instrumentation agent by setting the Java VM system
property as follows:

[source,bash]
----
-Dorg.apache.camel.jmx.disabled=true
----

The property value is treated as `boolean`.

Alternatively, add a `jmxAgent` element inside the `camelContext` element in
Spring XML configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <jmxAgent id="agent" disabled="true"/>
    ...
</camelContext>
----

In Java, you can disable JMX directly on the `CamelContext` as follows:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
camel.disableJMX();
----

== Camel JMX configuration options

Camel JMX can be configured with the following options.

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |JVM System Property |Default Value |Description
|`id` |  |  |*required* The JMX agent name

|`usePlatformMBeanServer` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.usePlatformMBeanServer` |`true`
|Whether to use the MBeanServer from JVM.

|`mbeanServerDefaultDomain`
|`org.apache.camel.jmx.mbeanServerDefaultDomain` |`org.apache.camel`
|The default JMX domain of the `MBeanServer`

|`mbeanObjectDomainName` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.mbeanObjectDomainName` |`org.apache.camel`
|The JMX domain that all object names will use

|`mbeansLevel` |  |`Default`
|Configure the level for which MBeans are registered.
See section _Registering MBeans for specific resources only_ for more details.

|`onlyRegisterProcessorWithCustomId`
|`org.apache.camel.jmx.onlyRegisterProcessorWithCustomId` |`false`
|If this option is enabled, then only processors with a
custom id set will be registered. This allows you to filer out unwanted
processors in the JMX console.

|`statisticsLevel` |  |`Default`
|Configure the level for whether performance statistics is enabled for the MBean.
See section _Configuring level of granularity for performance statistics_ for more details.

|`includeHostName` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.includeHostName` | `false`
|Whether to include the hostname in the MBean naming.

|`useHostIPAddress` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.useHostIPAddress` |`false`
|Whether to use hostname or IP Address in the service url
when creating the remote connector. By default, the hostname will be
used.

|`loadStatisticsEnabled` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.loadStatisticsEnabled` |`false`
|Whether load statistics is enabled (gather load statistics using a background thread per CamelContext).

|`endpointRuntimeStatisticsEnabled`
|`org.apache.camel.jmx.endpointRuntimeStatisticsEnabled` |`true`
|Whether endpoint runtime statistics is enabled (gather runtime
usage of each incoming and outgoing endpoint).

|`mask` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.mask` |`true`
|A flag that indicates whether to remove detected sensitive information (such as passwords)
from MBean names and attributes.

|`updateRouteEnabled` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.updateRouteEnabled` |`false`
|Whether to allow updating routes at runtime via JMX using the ManagedRouteMBean. This is disabled by default, but can be enabled for development and troubleshooting purposes, such as updating routes in an existing running Camel via JMX and other tools.

|=======================================================================

=== Registering MBeans for specific resources only

Camel automatically registers MBeans for the context, routes, and processors
when it starts up. However, you can specify a level to control whether
MBeans are registered at startup. The levels are:

* `Default` - Camel will register MBeans for the context, all the routes and the processors.

* `RoutesOnly` - Camel will register MBeans for the context and for all the routes (not for any processor).

* `ContextOnly` -  Camel will register MBeans for the context (neither for any route nor for any processor).

=== Registering new MBeans for new routes, created by route templates, Kamelets

Camel provides the following settings to control when to register mbeans.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Default |Description
|`registerAlways` |`false` |If enabled then MBeans are always registered.

|`registerNewRoutes` |`true` |If enabled then adding new routes after
CamelContext has been started will also register
MBeans from that given route.

|`registerRoutesCreateByKamelet` |`false` |If enabled then adding routes created by Kamelet will also register MBeans from that given route.

|`registerRoutesCreateByTemplate` |`true` |If enabled then adding routes created by route template (not Kamelet, see option above) will also register MBeans from that given route.

|=======================================================================

By default, Camel automatically registers MBeans for all routes configured at
startup. The `registerNewRoutes` option controls whether MBeans should also be
registered for new routes added later on. This feature can be disabled, for
example, if you are adding and removing temporary routes that do not require
management.

In *Camel 4.5* onwards, there are additional options to configure whether routes created from route templates or Kamelets
should be registered as MBeans or not. By default, Kamelets are now disabled with the intention to regard a Kamelet
as a component, instead of a set of additional routes and processors MBeans that is essentially unnecessary for management
and monitoring. The option `registerRoutesCreateByKamelet` can be set to `true` to enable MBeans, which is how Camel 4.4 or
older behaves. On the other hand, routes created from route templates (not Kamelets) are default enabled.

CAUTION: However, be cautious when using the `registerAlways` option in
conjunction with dynamic EIP patterns, such as the xref:components:eips:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List],
which have unique endpoints. This can potentially lead to system degradation
due to the increasing number of MBeans in the registry from its associated
services/producers. Keep in mind that an MBean is not a lightweight object
and consumes memory.

== Management naming pattern

You can configure a naming pattern for the MBeans names that Camel creates.
The pattern is used as part of the `ObjectName` as the key after the domain name.

By default, Camel will use MBean names for the `ManagedCamelContextMBean`
as follows:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=camel-1,type=context,name=camel-1
----

If you configure a name on the `CamelContext` then that name is part of
the `ObjectName` as well. For example, if we have:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="myCamel" ...>
----

Then the MBean names will be as follows:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=myCamel,type=context,name=myCamel
----

In the event of a naming clash within the JVM, such as when there is already an
MBean with the same name, Camel will automatically try to resolve the issue by
finding a new, available name in the `JMXMBeanServer` using a counter. For
example, the counter will be appended to the name, resulting in an `ObjectName`
such as `myCamel-1`:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=myCamel-1,type=context,name=myCamel
----

=== Naming Patterns

This is possible because Camel uses a naming pattern by default that
supports the following tokens:

* `\#camelId#` = the CamelContext id (eg the name)
* `\#name#` - same as `\#camelId#`
* `\#counter#` - an incrementing counter

If there is a naming clash in the `JMXMBeanServer` then Camel
will automatically fall back and use the `\#counter#` in the pattern to remedy
this. Thus, the following patterns will then be used: `\#name#-\#counter#`

If you set an explicit naming pattern, then that pattern is always used,
and the default patterns above are *not* used.

This allows us to have full control, very easily, of the naming for both
the `CamelContext` id in the Registry and the JMX MBeans in the `JMXMBeanRegistry`.

So if we want to explicitly name both the `CamelContext` and to use fixed
MBean names that do not change (i.e., without counters), then we can use
the `managementNamePattern` attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="myCamel" managementNamePattern="#name#">
----

Then the MBean names will always be as follows:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=myCamel,type=context,name=myCamel
----

In Java, you can configure the `managementNamePattern` as follows:

[source,java]
----
context.getManagementNameStrategy().setNamePattern("#name#");
----

== Configuring performance statistics

You can set a level for whether performance statistics are
enabled or not when Camel starts up. The levels are:

* `Default` - Camel will enable statistics for both routes and
processors (fine-grained).

* `Extended` - As default but with additional statistics gathered during
runtime such as fine-grained level of usage of endpoints and more.

* `RoutesOnly` - Camel will only enable statistics for routes (coarse
grained)

* `Off` - Camel will not use any statistics.


[NOTE]
====
*What does statistics enabled mean?*

Statistics enabled means that Camel will do fine-grained performance
statistics for that particular MBean. There are statistics you can see, such as number of exchanges completed/failed,
last/total/min/max/mean processing time, first/last failed time, etc.

====

Using Java DSL, you set the statistics level by:

[source,java]
----
// only enable routes when Camel starts
context.getManagementStrategy().setStatisticsLevel(ManagementStatisticsLevel.RoutesOnly);
----

And from XML DSL you can do:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <jmxAgent id="agent" statisticsLevel="RoutesOnly"/>
 ...
</camelContext>
----

=== Performance load statistics

It is possible to include load statistics for CamelContext and Route MBeans.
These statistics are for average load based on the number of in-flight
exchanges, measured over periods of 1, 5, and 15 minutes. This is similar to
load statistics on Unix systems.

You can enable this by setting `loadStatisticsEnabled=true`.

== Hiding sensitive information

By default, Camel enlists MBeans in JMX such as endpoints configured
using URIs. In this configuration, there may be
sensitive information such as passwords.

This will mask URIs having options such as password and
passphrase, and use `xxxxxx` as the replacement value.

=== Masking JMX attributes in custom components

When implementing custom Camel components, you can mark which
JMX attributes to mask with the `@ManagedAttribute` and `@ManagedOperation` annotations.

The `mask` attribute can be set to `true` to indicate that the result of this JMX
attribute/operation should be masked (if enabled on JMX agent, see
above).

For example, on the default managed endpoints from camel-core
`org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean.ManagedEndpointMBean`, we have
declared that the `EndpointUri` JMX attribute is masked:

[source,java]
----
@ManagedAttribute(description = "Endpoint URI", mask = true)
String getEndpointUri();
----

== Expose JMX metrics remotely

When you're running the application locally, you can use any JMX client (ie, `jconsole`) to access to the process and the the statistics exposed. However, you may want to expose these metrics remotely in order to be accessed by any remote process: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/remote/jconsole.html[expose the JMX metrics remotely].

NOTE: make sure to properly secure the access to JMX services for production workloads.

== How to use a Java Agent

Exposing the JMX metrics with its native protocol may not always be possible (ie, for firewall limitations, security, etc). In this case you may recur to the availability of JSR 160 compatible Java Agents (for instance, https://jolokia.org/reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-jvm[Jolokia]), which goal is to adapt the JMX interface with HTTP based protocol. With this approach you can run you application attaching a Java Agent whose goal will be to take care of exposing JMX via HTTP. As an example:
```
java -javaagent:jsr160-javaagent.jar -jar my-camel-app.jar
```
will expose certain endpoints (depending on the implementation) which would let you interact with JMX.

Depending on the implementation you will need to provide to a different set of agent configuration. For example, if you're running Jolokia agent, then, you will need to run this configuration to expose a plain HTTP unsecure service:
```
java -javaagent:jolokia-agent-jvm-2.1.1-javaagent.jar=protocol=http,useSslClientAuthentication=false,discoveryEnabled=false,host=*,extendedClientCheck=false -jar my-camel-app.jar
```
From that moment onward you will be able to access the service via:

```

$ curl http://localhost:8778/jolokia/list/org.apache.camel | jq | more
{
  "request": {
    "path": "org.apache.camel",
    "type": "list"
  },
  "value": {
    "context=camel-1,name=\"platform-http\",type=components": {
      "op": {
        "getCamelId": {
          "args": [],
          "ret": "java.lang.String",
          "desc": "CamelId"
        },
        "isHealthCheckSupported": {
          "args": [],
          "ret": "boolean",
          "desc": "HealthCheckSupported"
        },
        "getComponentName": {
          "args": [],
          "ret": "java.lang.String",
          "desc": "ComponentName"
        },
...
```

Each agent implementation may provide a different way to get and execute actions on the various endpoint.

WARNING: make sure to properly secure the access to the HTTP services for production workloads checking the specific agent configuration documentation.
= JSON

JSON is a xref:data-format.adoc[Data Format] to marshal and unmarshal
Java objects to and from http://www.json.org/[JSON].

For JSON to object marshalling, Camel provides integration with many
popular JSON libraries such as:

- Jackson
- Google GSon
- Johnzon

How to use JSON with Camel then see the documentation (for the JSON data library of choice)
in the list of xref:components:dataformats:index.adoc[Data Formats].
